  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey, friends, family, and future employers,

I bet you are all wondering what this blog is. I'm afraid I'm not particularly able to help. I don't what it is going to be, and the only thing I'm really trying to do at the moment is just get in the habit of posting so that I build up some momentum, and this blog doesn't join the millions of one-post wonders that litter the web. So I'm not going to put any restrictions on my content whatsoever, in the hopes of that way being able to use all and any thoughts, experiences, etc... I might have as potential post topics. Anyway, welcome, and I hope you find your stay here lovely. Please feel free to explore your surroundings, please admire this striking design. I chose it. Quite the shade of green, if I do say so myself.

-Speaking from the Slipstream,
Spencer.

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[the last one i submitted without finishing after i fell asleep due to jetlag.

so i've gotten through all your posts. not that much of a journey per say but it's been pretty interesting. one thing i do realize is that personalities don't change too much. maybe it's just because of the short history of the blog. this is something which i've realized already after going through a third of my archive. i don't wanna give any advice per say but just to say how i thought until recently i changed a lot over three years. turns out my personality hasn't really changed that much, only the way i look at issues and the world. 

i definitely think you're becoming more comfortable in voicing your emotional thoughts. sometimes you make it feel forced because you think readers wanna know. i guess that's true in some senses. your posts on cs and music are quite fascinating. i always google and end up liking the music. but these we can know just by asking you. 

 congrats. you're cool and your blog is too.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks, I really appreciate the comments. 

I think that there is a certain aspect of personality that doesn't change that much, some kind of essential set of preferences. There's a theory of personality which says that personality can be pretty fully captured by figuring out where people fall in five orthogonal dimensions: Openness, Extraversion, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. The idea is that people are essentially fixed for those traits throughout the course of a lifetime. And I guess I agree that there is some set of fundamental traits which are invariant, though I am not sure which traits would be in that set.

And so any observed changes in people over time would be the result of changing beliefs and perspectives, which seems intuitively plausible. So you could argue convincingly that people aren't ever really changing, though I think that neglects the meaning of changes that are observed. I mean empirically, there is nothing that constitutes personality without influencing action, and so it seems kind of silly to talk about personality as anything more than a set of tendencies towards action, in which case people are just the sum total of their actions. And if that is the case, then these relatively superficial changes are just as important as the unchanging traits, in that they affect the actions people take.

And I'm getting a little off-track, but I guess all that I want to say is that every change matters, and that any sort of fatalism about personality is unnecessary, since people can always change what they do, and they can always learn more, and they can always be more. I really do believe that. 

Also, I'm gonna start reading your blog. So be prepared...

BTW, are you in Beijing right now?

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Why am I posting right now? Because the time I spend posting would otherwise be spent doing my math homework, and I would rather share my innermost secrets with the anonymous hordes that lurk on the internet than do eight math problems, and go to sleep. Also, I turned the lights off a while ago, and I don't think I've ever been productive when the lights have been off. Bad decision. (Aside: Here is a potential insight that may appear as flimsy as a cardboard cutout of an action hero in the morning: Hindsight is not naturally biased towards an emotional understanding. Actually, as I was typing that past sentence, I realized that it was actually not that meaningful, but whatever...).

This may be obvious by now, but everything that ends up on the page bears the hallmarks of a tremendous struggle, and it may perhaps be productive to bear that in mind as you read. Be ever vigilant for the telltale scars that hint at the gauntlet endured just to make it to your ever receptive ears. 

But I digress, the point I'm trying to make is that I'm always a light breeze away from toppling over into the dry well of solipsism, and I apologize to the ever gracious and splendiferous reader if I inadvertently thereby bore his grace. 

What this means is: my metaphors are really showoff-y, I use big words, and generally attempt to impress upon you my intelligence with my every article and conjunction.

Whatever...

To the meat of the post:

Oh wait, there is none. 

Here's the best I can do at this ludicrous hour: I listened to the New Pornographer's Album <em>Twin Cinema</em>, and experienced something like a cosmic transcendance for a few fleeting minutes. In other words, it's really really good, and the force of its songwriting and sound are so clear to me right now, that I wonder what in the world had I been hearing that would lead me to the erroneous conclusion that I didn't like these Cool Canadians all that much at all. Perhaps, all albums sound better when coding. Perhaps, I had never actually sat down and listened to it, which is a scary thought, 'cause then there must be tons of gems in my current collection that haven't risen to my awareness. (Mixed metaphor #1 of the post).

Also, I found out by trying to get to my own blog via google that Starlings of the Slipstream is a super popular blog name. I have become the bad guy! I am the plagarists I used to condemn so readily.

Darn.

Anyway, to you fine folks,
I say "Goodnight, Greater Providence Metropolitan Area, and moreover, Goodnight to all of Rhode Island and the Providence Plantations"

-SL(U)G &lt;-My mysterious username (SOOOO Mysterious!!!) 

(Also in the future I hope to replace irreverence and absurdity with sincerity and candor, for those of you who were hoping for something else)]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, my blog is breaking all sorts of records, having just sped past the third post marker with no discernible fautigue. Well I watched <em>Pan's Labyrinth </em>today for the first time. Thoughts: Not nearly as good as the universal critical acclaim had led me to believe. Furthermore, I wasn't even able to tell what about it, theoretically, was supposed to be so good in the movie. Though I admit the visual design was solid, I didn't find its particular brand of fantasy to be that wonderful. The most interesting image, in my opinion, if I remember correctly, was actually revealed in the previews (Guy with hands in eyes). But I'm hard to please when it comes to the cinema, and I have a particular negative reaction to movies that I think were under-deserving of the attention lavished upon them. 

Further updates: I'm getting really into Vim. I am neutral re: THE EDITOR WARS, but I do very much enjoy Vim and am convinced that it will be a great boost to my productivity, after I've gotten acclimated to it. Already, I am beginning to find myself able much more to do exactly what I want. When I'm using Word or any other piece of writing software, I feel as though I am continually having to battle the software to accomplish what I want. With Vim (and I imagine with Emacs) I am in total control, and the only thing stopping me from realizing my most farfetched text-editing fantasies is my own lack of knowledge/experience. I like that a lot.

Other content: (Insight: I like Improv Comedy &lt;- (shouldn&#039;t be capitalized; too lazy to fix it) because it, among almost all the art forms I&#039;ve had the pleasure of experiencing, comes closest to capturing my ideal of art that is in no way contrived. Comedy for me would come from the interactions of characters, through their conversations, and the warm feeling of knowing what will make them happy or what will invariably trigger their laughter center. That comes off as more manipulative than I meant for it to be.) My favorite pieces of art are invariably those that present real characters, with realistic behaviors, and gives them free reign to be themselves. Nothing irritates me more in a movie than to be painfully aware of the fact that I am watching a movie. While I don&#039;t know how much I agree with the ideal of an art piece &quot;drawing you in&quot;, I do want to feel that I am being exposed to a world that is real, a world that persists outside the frame, and that is undetermined.

Finally, 

I am currently pondering the nature of computing. I think that as it stands now, human-computer interaction is sorely flawed. So often software is the obstacle to my realizing my imagination, and not the tool that helps me achieve my ends. Is this problem intrinsic to computers, as they are fundamentally about strong interfacing, and string processing (broadly used to mean all types of understanding that rely on discrete and sequential events)? Or will sufficiently advanced voice recognition, and data mining strip away that barrier? I think the answer is that we will always be limited by our tools, and that the tension that comes from the limits of our tools feeds our creativity, and spurs us on to greater art. Oulipo hit it on the nose, and then took the idea to its logical extreme. I am insufficiently familiar with that ouevre to comment, though I suspect that their works are held back at times by their formalities. I wonder how to establish a happy medium. Now I&#039;m getting too abstract, a cue for me to brush my teeth, and to sink softly into slow silent sleep.

PS: The post below was written yesterday, published today (due to technical difficulties (I pressed the wrong button)) Also, I&#039;m gonna try to get rid of nested parentheticals, as I don&#039;t really want them to join my already wonky arsenal of writing techniques.

-So that&#039;s it,
Spencer]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Ugh, short post for today before I go to sleep.

1. Saw acapella, began to get a good sense of what I like and don't like, and I don't like much.

2. Learned that programming in c is really really annoying b/c you basically are on your own in terms of bug-hunting. Actually, I just realized I was forgetting to gcc with -Wall enabled, but I'm too tired to see the difference tonight, and I will continue tomorrow. So, I don't know what I learned, though I think my facility with c increased a lot, and I now am a lot more comfortable with Pointers. I don't know why they have been giving me so much trouble, but I suspect it's related to Java being my home environment, and the weirdness of thinking of strings as arrays of chars, referenced by the first char. 

3. also, I just had a brilliantish idea for a tool that could be used by programmers. You know those box diagrams that all programming books use to represent pointers and references? What if there was a debugger of sorts that would visually show you the box diagrams for your variables, and so you could see exactly what was happening at each step? Also, the answer to that question is, "It would be awesome.", and I think that this idea falls into that category of ideas that are far harder to make work in practice than in my imagination.

4. I wonder what would be my ideal stereo sound layout for headphones. It bothers me to have drums in one ear and bass in the other, but i do like the added dimension that stereo adds to the music, the way in which you can almost picture the band playing. I guess the best I can hope for is a relatively equal contribution from both sides, and that shouldn't be too bothersome.

5. This is turning out to be longer than I imagined it would be.

6. (I wanna have something personally revealing, and/or emotionally involving in my posts, so that people reading it can get an understanding of me that they wouldn't get in person, since I don't really share all that much in most situations.) 

7. This doesn't really count as emotional, and so it gets its own number: I think that one major problem with any vision of an ideal future (either re: relationships, self, situation) is that we tend to think of the future (or at least I do) in static images. So we ask the question, "How do I want to be? How do I want to spend my days? How do I want to relate to a spouse, or partner?" But these questions are at best, unproductive, and can actually make one less happy. The problem is that people need novelty, and that much of the satisfaction in life is learning, and so no static image will seem all that great after a while. On the other hand, it is hard to imagine novelty in the abstract, to imagine anything that would be both satisfactorily complex and simple enough to provide short-run trajectories. Maybe that's just me. But that is why I (and so many others) have trouble understanding what they want for the future in any concrete way, and why the best laid plans of mice and men inevitably implode on their own expectations. Better to create a sturdy methodology, than to try to achieve any ends. This is kinda commonsense, I guess, but I think there's a solid idea somewhere in this that could be revealed after a good nights sleep. 

8. I'm pretty happy, for reasons that I will probably go into later.

-so long for some time. Be back soon though,
See ya,
Spencer

  <title>What's Going On (Not Marvin Gaye)</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So I rediscovered recently the song "What's Going On" by Husker Du, and I really think it is wonderful. The idea it puts across is not particularly complex, but the song expresses it with a stridency and honesty that is rarely found in the music I listen to.  Here are the lyrics:

I was talking when I should have been listening

I didn't hear a word that anyone said

It must not have been so very important

'Cause I was concerned about instead

So what's going on, what's going on

What's going on inside my head?

What's going on, what's going on

What's going on inside my head?

What's going on, what's going on

What's going on inside my head?

What's going on, what's going on

What's going on inside my head?

I was talking when I should have been listening

I didn't hear a word that anyone said

It must not have been so very important

'Cause I was concerned about instead

What's going on, what's going on

What's going on inside my head?

What's going on, what's going on

What's going on inside my head?

What's going on, what's going on

What's going on inside my head?

What's going on

Going on inside my head?

What's going on, what's going on

What's going on inside my head?

What's going on, what's going on

What's going on inside my head?

What's going on, what's going on

What's going on

I think it is one of those songs that just captures something so true and elusive that just knowing that there are words for it makes you feel better. Just hearing someone else admit that they feel that way as well is enormously reassuring, and (I'm not sure whether this is good) gives a sense of belonging that is so powerful it is almost instinctual. This explains the vehemence with which music fans argue for their favorite bands. They feel a kinship with them, they are fighting to have their particular tribe validated, to have a permanent chunk of land that is theirs. I'm not actually sure if I actually am confident enough in this sentiment and the corresponding explanation of it to stand by it, but I don't want to delete it on principle.

Also, I am going to a badminton match right  soon, so I will end the post right now.

Maybe I'll try to add a bit before I go to sleep]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Computer programming is weird. I've been thinking about this for a while now, and I've been thinking that there is something fundamentally wrong with my understanding of computers and of coding, and that some kind of paradigm shift is needed for computing to be as powerful as it should be. Because computers are really really impressive beasts, but it seems like inevitably we fail to use them in a way that really uses them to their full potential. That may just be the idealist in me squirming at the messiness of daily life, but I can't help but feel that programming is in some weird transitional period where the only thing that is clear is that the world is changing in fundamental ways and that nothing is gonna be the same ever again. 

The weird thing is that this is a discipline in which we are working backwards. Turing proved that there is a certain type of computation that can be done, and that this computation can be done by any machine, so long as it can act conditionally and utilize memory addresses. All machines that can do that are in a general sense equivalent. All computable things can be done on any computer.  When you execute a program written in C, the program is a binary executable that actually works at that level. So programming languages are just human-made structure imposed on the infinite space of possible computations. Assembly language is the first layer of structure that is imposed upon the raw computer, and then other languages are built from assembly languages, and then other languages are built from lower-level languages, and we keep piling on structure until we have something that human beings can deal with. 

What's so weird about this is we start off with as much power in the sense of direct control as we could ever possibly have, and then we pull back a step, building a wall to keep us away from internals of the machine. We put some windows in the wall, and we can control the computer through those, but then we decide that we are still too close, and we build another wall with even fewer holes. And we keep going, all the while getting further away from the computer and limiting the possibility space. By the end if we want to reach the computer in the center we have to travel a precarious and idiosyncratic route, and the fundamental nature of the underlying computation is gibberish to us.

And we choose to do this, and every year we build more and more walls.

Why do we do this? 

I'll talk more about this in my next post, but I have to study for a math midterm.

TO BE CONTINUED...

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So I just finished doing math homework, and I am procrastinating by blogging. During the last two and a half hour study session I listened to a Brahms Symphony, two albums by Big Star, an album by The National, and some undetermined percentage of Stand! by Sly and the Family Stone. Soon, I will put the headphones back on for another stretch, this time reading philosophy. Epistemology to be specific. Midterm tomorrow. Ughhhh. I have grown fond of this particular exclamation, and I think it captures with impressive economy that particular brand of annoyance that one meets at the middle of one's assignment. It says "I am going to have to keep going for some time, and I know it will be okay, but it sucks that I am spending my evening this particular way". Look at how much more verbose I have become. Here's what happened. I started naming albums, and BAM!, I am in Literary Mode, which means that my words grow like beanstalks from beans (horrid analogy), and I write sentences that test the breath of even the most practiced storyteller. 

You know that computer science post that I left unfinished a while back? Well, it inspired me to do some legitimate reading on the nature of computation, and the theory of programming languages, and so I am now in the middle of reading an annotated edition of Turing's 1936 paper. But, for the time being, I am not going to be able to finish that post. It will probably be better when it is finished.

I'll post later again.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I am posting now only in order to keep up my record of consistently posting, so that I may perhaps turn blogging into a habit like brushing my teeth and flossing. It would be lovely if three years from now, I could look back at the collected writings I'd made, and be taken back to myself when I was younger, remembering where I was and who I was with and what I cared about. But for this to work out, I have to actually keep up the posting, and get it so habitual I almost don't even think about it any more. 

What are some non-meta thoughts I've had lately? Well, first there is a class of albums I put on right before I go to bed, and though I don't know what makes them work for going to sleep, I just know whether or not they will work. Right now, for example, Roxy Music's <em>Avalon</em>. The soft sultry pulse, and Bryan Ferry's honeyed baritone. The sense one gets when listening to this album that every song is just on the verge of fading out at all times.  

Anyway, I'm going to sleep now, before I am no longer tired.

Through the soothing sounds of slippery guitars and soft synths,
Spencer, signing off for today.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[As a blogger, I am aware that I have great power. I am in control of the emotional wellbeing of my many legions of followers. I could, if I wanted, torment them with trivialities, or burden them with my difficulties, or incite their rage. I could do that, and since I'm belligerent, I may do that. 

It is my responsibility, however, to wield my power responsibly, only posting when I have something interesting to say. So that's why I'm telling you I went to Phonatic last night, a local Vietnamese restaurant that is good enough, cheap enough, and close enough to be a favorite of ours. I enjoyed it, and was no longer hungry for a while afterword. Success in my book!

<i> Change of topic </i>

Has anyone ever listened to the lyrics of half the songs in Anything Goes? They are pretty risque, and not just by the standards of 1934, but I don't "I Get a Kick Out of You" would make it on the radio these days. I can't even imagine how the audience must've responded when the musical was debuted. According to the internet (wikipedia), P.G. Wodehouse wrote the script for the show. Quite a team: Cole Porter and P.G. Wodehouse. 

The quality of that team reminds me of my favorite supergroup of all time: the short lived British group Electronic. The group consisted of 1) Johnny Marr, legendary guitarist of The Smiths, 2) Neil Tennant, one-half of the Pet Shop Boys, and 3) Bernard Sumner, singer and guitarist in New Order, and Joy Division. They had one hit and one album before disbanding to return to their respective groups. The song, "Getting Away With It" is not what you would expect when you put those three in a room, but I like it, and I would be interested to hear more.

Anyway, 
See you later,
Spencer

One note: "Mayan Science" would be a great band name. 

Or, stolen from a friend, "Mayan Silence". 

Also, listen to Big Star, because "Thirteen" will break your heart, and "In the Street" will put you back together. 

Also, <i> Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga </i> by Spoon is awesome. "Don't Make Me a Target" is ridiculously awesome.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey,

So I have an eventful couple of days, and its taken me until now to feel like I have the luxury to be able to sit still for a moment and reflect upon the events. That being said, at the moment I feel drained, and not particularly able or willing to perform the kind of self-analysis that I normally think of when I think of introspection. No, right now, all I want to do is lie on my bed and maybe do some reading for fun while listening to music. I've recently been adding music to my collection at a pace far too fast for me to be able to digest it all, and I am looking forward to making my way through it all in the next couple of weeks. I've been trying to fill in some of the gaps in my knowledge, genres that I have little understanding of, artists I managed to miss, albums that passed me by. So I got <i>In Utero</i>, <i>The College Dropout</i>, and all sorts of other stuff. 

I also have a bunch of computer science work to do this weekend, and I want to relax as well. Aside: I had forgotten how interesting Kurt Cobain's voice was. It is this weird nasally growl, that sounds like little else, even though aspects of it can be heard in all sorts of modern stuff. Also, I've been playing Spoon a lot recently, and I fell in love all over again with Britt Daniel's vocals, which never fail to amaze me. 

I've been thinking through my aesthetic beliefs, as I've been trying to reconcile some ambivalent thoughts. On one hand, I really do believe that the things I enjoy listening to, the books I enjoy reading, are in fact better than those I don't enjoy. I am not willing to say that my love of William James is entirely due to my context of beliefs and preferences, and has nothing to do with the texts I am reading. I don't think I am articulating this thought well, so let me try again. 

When I really love a work of art, in any genre (and I include nonfiction books, since I do think that they can be art in all senses of the word) I want to rush out and share the experience with everyone I run into. At these moments, I am convinced beyond any doubt that my reaction is not an accident, but that anyone who were to experience the work, would necessarily be convinced of it's brilliance. So when I listened to The New Pornographer's <i> Twin Cinema</i> and was struck by the sublime perfection of that album, I immediately started proselytizing my friends, sure that they would believe too, when they heard it in full. But even those friends who enjoyed it failed to see it's transcendent beauty, and it seems that I was alone in my reaction to it. This confuses me, because if my reaction is rooted in some quality inherent in the album, then how could it fail to induce the same reactions in others? I have some thoughts about this, but I am not yet sure of the answer, and I'm sure I'll talk about this again, so there is no great haste on my side. 

I've been told that some of my posts are really long, which I suppose is factually accurate, though whether or not I will take that into consideration when posting is still an open question. 

One last song: "Tired of Being Alone' by Al Green. This song has been running through my head for a while now, and you should go listen to it now. (Because you may or may not like it.)

  <title>Back in action</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, I'm back in action (by which I mean that I am posting on my blog again, after a 4-day lapse).

What was holding me up? Well, I was busy, and then I forgot, and I just remembered, as I came in out of the rain that now bombards our entire campus, reminding us that it is indeed winter, and that we shall not switch to t-shirts and jeans. Providence is not going to have any of that, and it'll make sure we layer up, no matter what it takes. So that means that it is raining, and I am sitting in my room, letting my hair slowly dry in the cool air, and basking in the warm glow of my laptop screen. And I am about to do philosophy reading. But for the time being I'm blogging, as you are well aware. 

To clarify, I actually did have some ideas before I started writing, but they were lost during a flight of fancy in which I attempted to come up with more and more elaborate and evocative images with which to convey the rain. I got tired of doing that, and just decided to move on (hence the lackluster angry Providence that was selected). But in the proces the ideas slipped away, and I am becoming increasingly aware of having written twoish paragraphs without any insights, information, investigations, without anything really at all.

A source (who has chosen to remain anonymous) tells me my posts are too long sometimes. I agree, but now I have come up with content, and will roll with it, so...

*CHANGE OF TOPIC*

I have becoming increasingly focused recently on the idea of embodiment. I have come to believe that many of the dissatisfactions I have with various philosophical theories are connected to their failure to realize the unity of experience. By this I mean to say that thought and deed only make sense together, and that any understanding that neglects their fundamental bond is going to fail to account for some aspects of how we subjectively understand our minds or our bodies. Just a quick example: In Epistemology, we spent a fair amount of time on theories of knowledge. Theories of knowledge are theories about what we mean when we use say we know something. Humans use the word knowledge without much difficulty in a huge variety of contexts, and can understand what is meant when the word is used by others, but it turns out that if you try to come up with a definition for the word, you quickly run into major difficulties. For a while I was confused by our focus on the semantics of this one particular word, but I have now come to the belief that this is in fact an issue of importance, that there is much to be learned by examining the word, as insular and abstract it might seem. This change of heart came about when I realized that people generally use knowledge to guide their actions, and that people, when asked to defend their actions, will talk about what they know, as though knowledge justifies action. In light of this, it becomes clear that an analysis of knowledge is more than just semantic hair-splitting. Instead, an analysis of knowledge is an exploration of the way in which belief, experience, and action are related, and with it we can understand the foundations upon which our lives rely. That was perhaps an overstatement, but I really should get to work, and so you will just have to live with it.

Until my next post, 
Sincerely, 
Spencer]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So I just listened to <em>Kaputt</em> by Destroyer, which is a really solid album, with some truly remarkable songs. "Bay of Pigs" is one of the best 11min songs I've heard in a while. Which reminds me. For some reason, I'd never actually listened CSNY, and I played "Suite: Judy Blue Eyes" a couple of times over the past week, and I really like it quite a bit. My favorite part is probably the end, which picks up the pace, switches to Spanish, and makes the rhythm awesome. I think this is one of those tracks that could be 10 times better with better production. I don't know what it is, but it feels a little thin, and distant at times. 

Listened again to the College Dropout, which is a stunning album, with about 8 or 9 songs that are stunningly good. His latest is in my todo list, and I imagine I'll eventually get to all of his stuff, though I really cannot stand the cover of <em> Graduation </em>. ]]></content:encoded>

I think this is one of those tracks that could be 10 times better with better production. I don't know what it is, but it feels a little thin, and distant at times. 

Listened again to the College Dropout, which is a stunning album, with about 8 or 9 songs that are stunningly good. His latest is in my todo list, and I imagine I'll eventually get to all of his stuff, though I really cannot stand the cover of <em> Graduation </em>.  That is not a particularly good reason, if one accepts the "don't judge a book by its cover" logic, but I think that there is a fair correlation between the aesthetics of the music and those of the album art, though I know a fair amount of albums which defy this correlation to such a degree that one would think it almost intentional. Of course, I can't think of a single example at the moment, but I'll try and write them down next time they come to mind.

Here's a thought: Should one judge works of art on how they feel about the works after experiencing them, or is the artist only responsible for the finite interval of experience? This question particularly comes to mind when reading short stories, which I find often evoke in me a certain exquisite anxiety. There is almost certainly none of that soaring sense of being alive that accompanies the best movies, music, or even full-length novels. Or maybe they aren't too different, actually, just different aspects of the same sympathetic impulse. What should one feel when confronted with a masterpiece, or to disavow objective standards, what unites the things that I consider masterpieces? It is not a conscious decision to label these works masterpieces, except insofar as I formulate the proposition that the work is one, and then intuitively know whether or not I believe the proposition. The question is then, what feeling do I associate with these works? What emotion do they evoke? 

Another thought: I, and I imagine many others, often experience what I call epiphanies, and what you may denote otherwise, in which I suddenly understand the world in a new light. Here is how I would describe the experience: I am thinking, and I am stuck in my thoughts, coming over and over again to conclusions which are in some way unsatisfying. No matter how I try to escape, I am unable to avoid the brute force of this conclusion. And then, without warning, it becomes exceedingly evident that what seemed to me an unsolvable puzzle was in reality no puzzle at all, and that I only perceived it to be one by assuming some propositions that were false. 

Final thoughts before getting this published: So it's like 70-75 degrees out right now, and every single person is on the Main Green. The only time I can remember it this crowded out was during orientation, but it is pretty close right now. It is a beautiful day, and the campus is more alive than I have seen at all this year. For the first time, I may actually have trouble studying due to the weather.

Here comes the Sun,

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So I'm feeling really good right now, as I get ready to go to sleep. I am feeling just very content, and right at home right now. I don't know what particularly is causing this, but I know I wouldn't rather be anywhere else right now. That's a rare feeling, and I'm afraid that if I stay up too long, I will somehow manage to screw it up. I'm gonna keep this short for that reason, and the only thing I want to say right now is: Goodnight, and I'll see you tomorrow.

  <title>Serenity Prayer</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I really like the serenity prayer. I think it is a wonderful sentiment, expressed concisely. For those of you who don't know it (though you might know it, not by name), here is the most common version, according to wikipedia: 

<blockquote>God grant me the serenity 
to accept the things I cannot change; 
courage to change the things I can;
and wisdom to know the difference.</blockquote>

Goodnight,
Reporting across vast reaches of silent space, across a sky of shimmering stars, I transmit through a thread woven into the endless blanket that keeps us all warm,
Spencer.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[There's a great line in a Dismemberment Plan song, something like, "What do you want me to say to let you know that I still love you". What may sound flat on the page sears in the song, as Travis half screams, half begs to know how to make his lover understand him. Or something like that. A lot of lyrics I like are not particularly complex, but they are sentiments that are rarely found in pop music, articulated clearly, sentiments which I myself have had, but have failed to articulate. Others are particularly evocative images, or exceedingly clever and simultaneously true. I don't like clever that seems to be devoid of meaning, though I'm not actually sure when I think about it what that would look like. I'll come back to this post a little later, and add to it.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So, as I hope you have noticed, I haven't posted anything in about a week, and anything in much longer than that. (self-deprecation...) But now I'm back, and, I'm excited to say, full of random junk that I will probably write down and post, because better have the detritus of my mind online instead of tucked away in the corners of my hard drive, rotting away. 

I'm just bounding with optimism and energy today. That actually was not sarcastic, but I am so deeply habituated to voicing enthusiasm and such only in a sarcastic manner that I naturally come across as sarcastic even when genuinely thrilled. Again, to emphasize, I am really feeling good. 

I'm in LA by the way, City of Angels, America's Second Largest City, and a really weird place to grow up. I'll be here for about a week, and then it's back to Providence, as school starts up again. My plans this week are minimal, just hang out with some friends, show some friends around the city, and catch up on sleep, relaxation, schoolwork, all that stuff so that when I return, I can focus on the future, unburdened by the detritus of the past couple months. (Second usage of the word in one post.) Before I forget, I'm reading a really good book, <i> The Information </i> by James Gleick, which is a whirlwind tour of information and communications technologies and theories through all of history. That doesn't do it justice, and I'm not done with it, so I will hold back on recommending it yet, but so far it is awesome. Last point before I end this post: I'm going on a date with a certain person when I get back to Providence, and I am super-psyched about that, though nervous as well. I have a lot more to say, but I want to get this post published to make my return official, and I'll be back soon.

Goodnight, Providence,
Good Morning, Los Angeles, 
Welcome back, blog.

Returning soon,
Spencer.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Here's a thought:

I've been thinking a lot about how people work, about why they believe the things they believe, and the ways in which they change their beliefs and behaviors. I realize this might not sound like I've been doing anything unusual, but to me at least, my current thinking differentiates itself with its emphasis on <b>psychodynamics</b>. I use the word in a slightly idiosyncratic way, so to clarify, I mean by 'psychodynamics' the study of how ones thoughts and beliefs interact with the world, how thought processes evolve. This is still unclear I think, so here's an example: Let's say that I believe that I am an unlikable person. As a result of this belief, I am liable to interpret many of my interactions differently than I would if I were confident in my own likability. When I am greeted coldly by a friend, I can interpret that piece of data in many different ways, and the choice between interpretations is reliant on my pre-existing beliefs. In this case, I might come to the conclusion that I offended the friend, or that they don't want to spend time with me on the basis of this interaction, when it is quite possible that the friend is just in a bad mood, and would rather not socialize at the moment. 

Because one's thoughts influence the way they experience the world in the future, it is possible for feedback loops to arise, self-sustaining behaviors and thoughts that distort one's personality and wreak havoc on one's ability to react to the world as it is, rather than as they imagine it to be. Normally, any beliefs I have about the external world are kept in check by the external world. When a belief I have comes into conflict with the external world, I revise the belief, reconciling my representation with the fact of the matter. This is the dynamic that is seen in someone who is psychologically healthy, and one can see how a person who operates in this way will over time grow and prosper. Note that this model intuitively explains the common use of the term "well-adjusted" as synonymous with healthy, as it describes someone who adjusts over time to the world.

The alternative to "well-adjusted" would then be a failure to adjust. Somehow there has to be a severing of the interactions between world and belief. If a person is incapable of incorporating new data from the world into their understanding in a meaningful way, they are going to be severely handicapped in their ability to be happy, since the world is unpredictable and any attempt to control the world is ultimately doomed to failure. I know that those last assertions are metaphysical in nature, but I think most of you will agree with some variant along those lines, and the exact formulation is irrelevant for my purposes. I do hope to go into those propositions in more depth in a later post. I will leave you for now, but next post I will talk about possible manifestations of these cancerous self-sustaining thought-processes. 

Sorry for the cliffhanger,
Spencer.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey, so I know I left you hanging at the end of that last post, but this post is unfortunately not going to be a continuation of that one. The second part will come soon though, so don't fret too much.

The Deal: I listened to My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, henceforth abbreviated as MBDTF because I am lazy, and it was amazing. Kanye has this amazing ability to, at the flip of a switch, go from braggadocio to vulnerability, and this album takes that line and plays with it through the duration. It's really powerful to see the lonely and self-loathing guy underneath the mask of confidence and arrogance that so often is worn by Kanye. I don't like the way that music these days is sometimes about the artist, to the point where the songs are subordinate, but I can understand that temptation in talking about this album, which is so transparently personal. The songs themselves are really well done. First of all, everything sounds great, and the album just radiates the kind of big budget shiny production, that, when done right, can make an album seem magical, and almost supernatural. Or maybe that's just me. Anyway, songs like "All of the Lights" and "Runaway and "Lost in the World" just are immediately gripping, with fascinating stories to tell, and gorgeous music behind them. I was worried that the amount of guest stars would make the album feel hokey, but they are used very effectively, and they are integrated seamlessly with Kanye's own material, so that nothing is unnecessarily distracting. The album is also filthy, just really filthy, if that matters to you. It's a really coherent and cohesive statement from a man who is obviously wrestling with some major demons, and I wholeheartedly recommend it. I know I haven't really described the music, but I need to listen to it more to be able to do that, and I want to get some initial thoughts out onto the page.

I am feeling good, and I was going to explain why, but I think I will now just say, that things are good, the world is good, and all is good. Goodnight.

Sweet Dreams,
Spencer.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>So I figured out why my posts became so infrequent, and I'm fixing it</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Here's why:

At some point without realizing it, I stopped thinking of my posting as being whatever I wanted, and decided that I had to impress with my posts, or that at least I had to have something to say each time. And so I became convinced that I had to take time to post, and that i couldn't just dash them off without thinking about them. This is what I thought. Now though, I think that I will just write whatever I want to, no matter whether it be insightful commentary, or solipsistic drivel. No, I refuse to care what anyone thinks of it.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey, 

I'm back in Providence. The city. In Rhode Island. Why am I being obnoxious about describing my location? I don't know.

Here's a thought: I have, for many years, been under-supplied in self-esteem, forced to make do with far less than your everyday average normal guy, and thus, over time, I' ve developed a set of behaviors and beliefs that are different than those developed by your everyday average normal guy, and now, despite what my self-esteem may be at any particular moment, I handle situations with a lot of the residue of my former state. This is an exceedingly convoluted, and unnecessarily roundabout way of saying that no matter what self-esteem I possess at any given time, I am liable, when anxious, to revert to a low self-esteem version of myself, which makes life really difficult. 

Also, I'm gonna finally finish up that post that I promised I would continue way back when (<a href="http://starlingsoftheslipstream.wordpress.com">this one</a>). Basically, low self-esteem is neurotic and an inhibitor of healthy growth because it is self-sustaining. So if I believe that I am unlikable, I don't go out much, and don't find any opportunities to be disproven. When people compliment me, I see their words as white lies, or self-deceptions, or simply false, for the simple reason that they don't yet know the true me, the one who is fundamentally a failure and fraud. Maybe they caught me in a moment of ordinary competence, and were mislead into believing that I was competent, while to me I am well aware that I am constantly in danger of collapsing into a puddle of slime, only remaining in this human form out of pure inertia. (Well, I started writing that, by which I mean, trying hard to make it vivid and literary, and was diverted from my expository goals.) I mean, that is not literally true. But, the point, which has yet to be made to my satisfaction, is that I see the world differently if I have low self-esteem, and that without conscious reflection on my own thinking, it is quite likely that I see in every interaction further evidence of my own wretched state. I become immune to evidence, and that's the root of the problem.

And now I'm going to bed. 

GOODNIGHT.
Spencer says "GOODNIGHT".]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Oh solipsism, my friend, how good it is to see you again. 

I had some really class quote that I was going to use up there in that first sentence, but then I forgot it, but then I remembered it about 3 words ago. And here it is "Hello darkness, my old friend, I've come to talk with you again." I was going to replace "darkness" with "solipsism", because that way I am not forced to think about the meanings of the things I am saying, instead trafficking in the particulate matter of common culture that has slowly accumulated on every exposed surface in my life. There, I used a simile that subtly transitioned into a metaphor. Wow, I'm brilliant. (Just to be clear, I am being sarcastic there. Nevertheless, I am not saying that I am not brilliant, just not commenting either way. It's up to you to decide.) Uggghhh, I'm even annoying myself right now. 

I wish I knew how to get myself out of bad moods. Currently, the best I can do is "Spencer, you'll get over it, and don't let yourself make more out of it than you need to, because this happens all the time. It means nothing." It is not so bad, but I wish there was something I could do besides wait it out. Ugghhhh. 

I should probably do the homework that I am writing this post to avoid. Will I? I don't know anymore.

Goodnight Moon.

Good Day Sunshine.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So I just finished talking to some friends. During the conversation, I very clearly stated my belief that I will get better at blogging over time, and that if I just keep doing it, the quality will take care of itself. We'll see, though I don't know at all.

Basically I worked myself into a foul mood, though I have managed to keep the foulness to myself, and I am now trying to do work, failing miserably, and so I think I'm just gonna go to sleep. I don't think I've ever had anything good happen when in this mood.

Retracing my mood over the last hour, I am trying to figure out exactly what caused it to sour. It was some combination of the thought that a potential girlfriend will remain just potential, because I keep screwing up in stuff, and the thought that some people don't really care about me that much. I can rationally say that these thoughts are not grounded in fact, but nevertheless, I am unable to feel the emotions they provoke, and that is incredibly frustrating. I feel helpless, and the last thing I want to do right now, is go to sleep. It feels like I would be giving up by going to sleep, that I would be accepting my depressing fate. Again, I know that this is not true. Sure feels that way though.

As I continue to introspect (and blog), I am getting better at controlling my emotions, though I doubt that the cause of this improvement can be found in the introspection alone, since I've been doing that for years. Whatever the case, I am much improved in understanding my moods. Where before they seemed fickle and all-powerful, I now recognize to a small extent causes, and am able to see them as temporary. 

An idea: People are always unable to separate how the worlds seems to them, and how the world is. That is the very definition of reality, to think of the two as the same. If an argument seems convincing, then it will appear true. Truth is simply what seems to be right. This is a pernicious and insidious form of blindness, that can never be eliminated, and the only thing to do is to become more aware of it. Strengthen the link between world and mind, so that what is fact is fact, and what only seems to be fact is known as such. That sounds vacuous and glib, devoid of meaning and grace. It's not great, but I really want to get this sleeping started, so that I can finish early in the morning, and do my work. So I say to you for like the fourth time tonight, GOODNIGHT.

I am tiring of having to invent a new closing for every post, so I wont this time.
Spencer.

(Also, remind me to explicit discuss internet privacy in a future post, 'cause I am ambivalent, and it would do me good to organize my thoughts on the subject.)]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I am tired after only two days back in school, I feel as though I'd never left. I am not unhappy, simply weighted down. 

I was going to post some new ideas, but I forgot them as I killed time before the writing of this post.

I remember now the convoluted path that got me here. I was sitting around, minding my own business like I do on any given day. And then, BAM, I am sneezing like every couple seconds, and there is a tickling at the back of my throat, and my eyes are starting to water, and I am feeling like doing anything but the work that I need to do. 

But I want to just get something done, and I actually think I will right now.... (To be continued after some work is done.)

Wow, I actually got some good work done just now...

I kind of want to go do more of it, cause that would be awesome...

Oh wow, it is now much later than it was. I'm tired, and I kind of just want today to be over so that tomorrow can be here. 

I'm feeling empty, drained of all energy and initiative, ready to melt into my blankets, to renounce my autonomy and sink slowly into the bed.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Friday Night's Alright for Fighting</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So why is this post titled in the way that it is titled? Because it is Friday, and the only thing I like less than a really stupid pun is a topical reference, which in this case would inevitably and inexorably be a reference to the song of the same name as this particular day, and I don't want to get involved. If you don't know what I'm talking about, you are better off that way.

As for the meat of the post, I haven't talked about all that much recently, so I will quickly do some music:

<i>If You're Feeling Sinister</i> by Belle and Sebastian is in my top 10 albums of all time, and I am recommending to all human beings unconditionally.
Also good: <i>Armchair Apocrypha</i> by Andrew Bird, and Al Green's <i>Greatest Hits</i>. Go hunt them down, and enjoy.

Oh wow, now I'm switching to books:

If you want a great introduction to epistemology, check out Michael Huemer's <i>Skepticism and the Veil of Perception</i>. It is a very edifying book, and the one of our course books that for me most helped me get the bigger picture of epistemology. 

So enough about stuff, let's talk about things: Algorithms, the study of which is the nexus of my current library book binge. That, and Combinatorics, which is, to my mind, a field which never ceases to surprise and delight me. I don't yet know all that much on the topic, but I'm enjoying the exploration already. 

Why do I like Providence? Probably because it is filled with people I love to spend time with, and people who I'd love to spend time with, and because we hug the riverbank here on College Hill, cradled between a church that exemplifies the simple elegance of so much of New England Protestantism and the University-at-Large, a complex and chaotic grid of buildings of every shape and size. 

I always debate when I am writing these posts over what I think I should talk about. I assume that my readers would prefer discourse, or specific descriptions of art or events, or any kind of narrative. And I often like to share the pearls of wisdom that I think I've picked up over the years, and I don't know how my audience thinks about those at all. But I guess I don't really want to make this blog into work, since that would mean its slow painful death, and in order to prevent that, I must impose as few limits upon myself as possible. I guess I have to trust that the things on my mind are interesting, and that I don't need to push myself very much to produce the kind of content I want to be producing.

I guess the only way to resolve this dilemma once and for all is to formulate a mission statement for this blog. I know that I am usually bored by talk of the purpose of organizations, and, moreover, all talk in the mode of stipulation, as I find it to be invariably without propulsive force, lacking the constraining force of the real world, and empty of specifics that can illuminate the meaning of these value words.

Whoa, I actually liked that little digression, and would like to pursue it further, but for now, mission statement. Also, when I said "stipulation" before, I meant the mode of naming, which I think is a little bit different. 

Okay, I know we are smack-dab in the middle of post, but I'm gonna publish this, and finish up in a part two tomorrow, so that I can get to sleep as soon as possible. Don't wanna mess up my sleep schedule any more than I absolutely have to.

(To be continued...)

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So yeah, here is my newest post. In which I continue <a href="http://starlingsoftheslipstream.wordpress.com/2011/04/09/friday-nights-alright-for-fighting/">this post</a>. So read that, or risk not knowing some important context. Nah, just kidding.

Here's where we were: I was going to formulate a mission statement for my blog. 

Here's one: I will write whatever in the world I care about. I will have no mission. The only thing I will try to do is keep my posting regular.

So I was thinking a while back about how programming is just way harder than it should be, and I had been unable to articulate exactly why that was the case. Well, I was reading the excellent <i>Algorithmics</i>, Third Edition, by David Harel with Yishai Feldman, and they had a section on this very topic. I thought it was excellently done, and so I'll share with you the summary of what they said: So their first point was that as you increase the size of a computer program you exponentially increase the number of different states that you have to deal with. In continuous systems, you can slide along a number of quantitatively different states without having something that is qualitatively different. The example they use is driving a car: Despite there being an essentially infinite number of speeds that the car can drive at, there are up to five different positions for a manual transmission, and all speeds at a particular gear are the same for the driver. On the other hand, because all changes are discrete in a computer system, there is no way to capture something quantitatively different without having flipping some bits. Every bit you add to the system doubles the number of possible states the system can be in. 

For those who are mathematically inclined, this discreteness means that computer systems are utterly intractable to analysis (meaning calculus). There is literally no such thing as a smooth change in a computer, which, when you think about it, is fundamentally different from our everyday experience and makes for an entirely different way of thinking about things. Smooth systems also get the advantage of cushioning, in that engineers can build bridges that are designed to withstand three times as much weight as is expected to be crossing the bridge at any time. By sacrificing efficiency a little bit, they are able to dramatically increase safety, and protect themselves from unexpected conditions. But all unexpected conditions in a computer are fundamentally different, and so there is no way to build a program that is tolerant. It's hard to understand what that would even mean? Even the smallest changes are carried through the program, and so the design has to be airtight to protect against the effects of any errors. In the bridge example, on the other hand, if more weight than expected is on the bridge due to a traffic jam, so long as the tolerance is great enough the system can react accordingly, as the structure absorbs the excess weight.

Now add in the fact that software can be changed and distributed rapidly, in contrast to a bridge which is made of metal and concrete. To change the bridge, you have to break out sledgehammers at the very least, and for anything at all involved, you are bringing in cranes and cement trucks, and bombing things. To change software, you never need more than one guy at a keyboard. This superficial ease of modification makes people think that software should be highly responsive, and bug-free. Why shouldn't a developer be able to make fixes as soon as they are spotted, and why shouldn't it be simple to implement your suggestion. I mean, it's just glowing dots on a screen. It's not like it's set in stone. 

Well, it may not be set in stone, but any sufficiently large program is far too large to be understood completely, and is so complex that it is often very very difficult to know how a change in one place will affect another location. It is simply a fact that most systems powerful enough to be useful to people are so complex that they are impossible to analyze. To prove that they are correct is an even harder problem, and to make it even worse, it has been proven that this problem in general is undecidable. Let me repeat this, because it takes a while to sink in: There is no hope of finding a general solution to the problem of verifying software, which means you can never be guaranteed to be bug-free. 

That makes things hard enough: then add in the fact that human beings have a lot of trouble reading and understanding code, even code they themselves wrote, and you end up with a discipline that counter-intuitively judges code quality by how easy it is for human readers to understand, and encourages a way of coding that is all about human understanding at the expense of computational efficiency and program brevity. 

Current research in computer science is all about trying to make coding easier, and there are a number of approaches that have been tried. A lot of people who are unfamiliar with programming look at the proliferation of programming languages, and are baffled. To them it seems utterly redundant to have both Python and Ruby, Perl and Scheme and Lisp and Racket, and C and Haskell and Lua and Scala and Groovy and Ada and Go and OCaml and Tcl and Rust and Eiffel and Erlang and Euphoria. (I kinda went overboard there, but I really like the names that programming languages end up with. They are so strange, and evocative.) While there is an argument to be made that the increased competition in the modern market for programming languages is inspiring them to continually improve, the more fundamental reason for this chaotic jumble of languages is more subtle. 

Since Alan Turing's landmark paper sometime in the first couple decades of the 20th century, it has been known that all sufficiently powerful programming languages are essentially equivalent, in that they are capable of expressing the same programs. Any language that satisfies this requirement is called Turing-complete, and the vast majority of popular languages these days are Turing-complete. What makes each language different then is the way in which it forces someone programming in that language to think about the task at hand. When you start coding in a particular language, you become subtly influenced by that language's syntax and semantics, and only when you switch to another language are you able to see the way in which each language presents an entirely different worldview. For example, in Racket and Scheme, the fundamental unit of data is the list. When you think about performing operations, you think about recursively traversing lists, and rebuilding them in strange and creative ways. When you code in Java, you think of designing a set of components that you are going to then fit together, and you try to make sure each component is designed so that it interacts with the others only as much as it needs to. Literate programming, a relatively new paradigm based on human readability, aims for code that flows on the page, and where the documentation is integrated into the code itself, and is interactive.

And that's some thoughts on computer science. I'm done for today, but I'll be back soon.

From a far corner of the slipstream, sliding down waterfalls, and blue electric veins, through crisp black buzzing city nights, whistling in the dark,
So long, 
Spencer]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Teeny-itsy-bitsy post:

I feel like standup comedy has backed itself into corner, and that it could be so much better if some of the conventions that are associated with it ceased to exist. I guess I don't really see the goal of the ideal performance that I'm imagining to be most laughs, or best joke or anything, but rather most pleasantly surprising, and I don't know a way to articulate this that doesn't sound incredibly domestic, and sanitized. I don't care about the content's being inappropriate or sexual, or whatever, so long as it was told sincerely. I guess that my biggest problem with comedy is the tone that it is so often associated with. I'm all about sincerity as a moral value, as an aesthetic value, and I hate the way in which comedians seem to constantly be mocking people who are sincere and seem to revel in the sarcastic response. 

This is not entirely related, but: I have recently been thinking about who my heroes are. Who lived their life in the way that I want to live mine, who approached the world the way I want to approach the world? Who cared about the things that I care about? 

The list is pretty short right now, and there are actually only two names that are finalized:

David Foster Wallace (Tentative)
William James (Tentative)
Robertson Davies (Tentative)
Stefan Sagmeister
Mr. Rogers

Why are these people on the list, and why are the tentative names only tentative? I'll get to that in the next couple weeks.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I hate waiting. I hate it so much. I can't even begin to express how much I hate waiting. Just kidding, I think I have just now done a pretty good job of capturing it. 

begin free-association:

nature's made of gold, permanent fixture, a golden chandelier swinging gently in the lobby of the Ritz, rolling with the smooth pitch of a ship floating in the middle of the ocean. 

Nature's a graveyard, a dorm room strewn with the dried bones and plastic wrappers of a year spent shedding, the left-behind loose skin, and dusty air. I guess I'm not really in the mood for anything like Love.

But who is? Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it.

Do you think you'd be better off if you didn't ever come here, if you left instead on a great big clipper ship, and sailed into the light blue fog, the places where the morning air is thrilling, is gorgeous, makes you dream of the future, makes you want to be right there, and where you can't think of a thing that you are waiting for. 

Oh god, do you know what it feels like to have someone breathing, laying their head on your chest, your arm cradling theirs?

Well, I'm ambivalent about posting this, because on the one hand I think that I don't want future employers to read it and judge me negatively, though I do think that I should be able to say whatever I want without having to fear the repercussions. But maybe that is too much to ask, maybe I don't get that, and maybe no one gets that, and maybe we should all just stop talking for one goddam minute.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello,

I'm awake right now.

This is not a good time to be awake because as the night passes before me my day tomorrow suffers accordingly, and I am almost positive that I will not be able to get up at the time that I want tomorrow if I go to sleep much later than like right now.

But why am I awake then?

Because I haven't decided a thing, and I cannot keep waiting. My patience ran out a long time ago, and now I'm just beating my head against a wall, and hoping that things will change, which is a stupid idea if I've ever heard one. I've been listening to good music at least. <i>Kaputt</i> by Destroyer, which is racing up my charts with astounding speed, and now is in my top 20 albums of all time after about 15 listens. Next up <i>Pleased to Meet Me</i> by James, which I think I'm gonna love in a couple of listens, but which mostly struck me as being very interesting this time around. I don't know what to make of the album, and the band is kind of a cross between The Divine Comedy, Blur, and The Verve. I need to listen to it more. <i>Learning to Crawl</i> by the Pretenders was up next, and that album is as expected, amazing. "Back on the Chain Gang" is a beautiful and wondrous song. I had to stop myself before getting very far into it, for fear of not really relishing each song as it presented itself to my consciousness. 

Now, <i>Turn on the Bright Lights</i> by Interpol, which I always like, but have trouble really loving, mostly because the band seems to be devoid of a distinctive point of view, a take on the world that is reflected in everything that they do. 

I really am antsy today, because I feel like things are unfinished. I keep feeling like I am being denied something that I deserve, which is a feeling that I really need to be aware of, because the second I get self-righteous I am blinded to all rationality. I think I am okay today, but I live in constant fear of that side of myself emerging. 

So I don't remember where I read this, but some guy's dad always used to tell him to never trust anyone who wouldn't get drunk in front of you, or that wouldn't let you see them puke into a toilet. And this struck a chord with me, because I am afraid of getting drunk, because I don't really trust myself all that much, and the idea of letting go of all control for even a minute is beyond terrifying to me. I am not handling things well. 

Now this is not to say that I want to get drunk, but rather that I want to be comfortable enough with myself so that I am not afraid of what I might do or say or think. 

I am getting better at this, and I no longer am generally afraid of the things I could do or say, but I think there is a long way to go before I am entirely comfortable in my own skin, which is a little bit of a sad thought.

So before this post, I had another post, in which I free-associated and used some curse-words, and I was afraid to post it, because of what employers might think, which I suppose is a valid reason to abstain, but I also felt a pang of guilt upon censoring myself. Because, I am not speaking to anyone in particular, and I am just saying things that come to mind, and I don't know why anyone could object to that. 

Because I fundamentally do believe that no one has the right to not be offended, and that it is always morally wrong to censor, no matter how good the intentions may be. And I realize that this may sound extreme, but I have a belief that shame, that the self-loathing that inevitably comes on when one feels censored, is the worst thing in the world. Shame is the worst thing in the world, because people are people, and because the most you can ask is for any to try their hardest. 

If you try your hardest, and do the best that you can, you are clean in my book, and you have no grounds for shame. I don't want to give off the impression that shame is blameworthy, so that one who is ashamed of himself is morally wrong, but rather that this person is being cruel to himself, and that this person doesn't deserve to be ashamed. Shame is also painful in a way that is almost impossible to understand until you feel it, and to the person who is continually ashamed, there is no way to curl up tight enough to no longer be a needle in the arm of the world. He thinks that he is a disease upon the world, and that he is not fit to live among others who superficially are members of the same species. He seeks to make himself as little as possible, so that maybe the world wont even notice his existence.

This is wrong, and a horrible way to be, and I can't think of a thing worse than that feeling.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello,

So I've been feeling down for about 3 days now, and I don't really know what to do to feel better, and I don't want to do anything at the moment. So that sucks.

Okay, time has elapsed since that first sentence and I am prepared to get on with the business of day-to-day life.

Over this past couple days, I wrote two posts that I was hesitant to publish, though in the light of day they don't seem particularly objectionable. 

Anyway, I want to get them up on the site, but I'm uncomfortable having them occupy prime real estate on the front page, so I'm gonna wait until I can figure out how to create a separate page for them, in which they would appear, and not on the front page. I realize that if I were actually concerned about privacy, this would not be a substantive improvement to the security of my words, but it is more for people who have finished with the greatest hits, and are ready to move on the deeper cuts. Also, I'm being semi-serious, so please don't accuse me of egotism (though I do think at times I am an egotist). 

Here's one thing I'm worried about: I choose imagery when I'm writing on the basis of how evocative it is, and that naturally means that I am going to tend towards dramatic images, rather than mundane ones. And I worry that it will appear as though the sentiments expressed are as powerfully felt as the imagery, even though I let the imagery have free reign, and just enjoy seeing what I can spin.

Is that a legit worry? Does anyone care? Should I stop blogging about myself? Maybe.

Anyway, I hope to get that up soon.

Also, before I log off (metaphorically, I won't actually log out ever really...) you might have noticed some changes to the site in recent days. I don't really have anything big planned at the time being, but there might be some changes in the future, and if you have any suggestions, I would be happy to take them. Also, I feel silly addressing my readers, because, at the moment I don't think I actually have any.

Whatever, goodbye.

Be back soon,
Spencer.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I am in the middle of a project that requires substantial debugging. I don't enjoy doing it.

I don't know how to handle it very well. I don't know how to handle it at all really.

Anyway, a day later I am sitting here, listening to <i>Summerteeth</i>, an absolutely gorgeous album that I instantly recommend to all human beings.

That's all for now, and now the day later, I am finishing the post I started a long time ago. This is taking forever, and I don't have much of a good reason, and I am a little bit frustrated by it. I am now going to figure this out. Actually, I'm just going to post this, because this is going nowhere, and I know that if I force myself to keep writing, I am just going to get more irritated, and I won't like whatever it is that I end up writing. 

So goodbye for now, and I'll try and post later tonight, when I actually have something to say.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Good morning Providence and the rest of New England, and may the sun shine upon all your endeavors today.

So I've been in a state of mind recently where I seem to experience little epiphanies on a weekly basis, if not more often than that.

Unfortunately I am worried that I will lose sight of these revelations when I need them most in the future, and I want to have them inscribed somewhere so that I can be often reminded of them. While I don't think that my blog is the place for this, I want to organize my thoughts, and so here is a rough draft of my recent epiphanies (also, I recognize that these are going to sound pretty prosaic, but they are here because they have recently become alive to me for the first time):</blockquote>
This is what I had planned to write, and had started to write  couple of days ago, but I never got around to finishing it, and I can't think of an appropriate way to finish it, so I'm going to go ahead and write something else, 'cause I cannot spend my time doing this. I don't know what I am doing at the moment, and I am tired, and I am just about to go to sleep but I don't want to go to sleep having not posted anything in a while.

I don't have many thoughts at the moment, and I don't want to ramble on tediously. I feel very heavy, heavy with thought, like I can't work up the energy to do anything good.

I should just go to sleep, and I will soon, but I can't help but feel as though if I were to go to sleep now, I would be giving up, letting the thoughts that swarm like bees through my mind continue their mad flight all night. I really really need to go to sleep. Ok, goodnight.

  <title>Back on the wagon</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So the old blog has been slow these past couple days, and I have been unhappy about that. I keep forgetting that I don't have to say something insightful or share an interesting experience in order to post. No, I can just complain about how busy I am, and watch the pageviews explode, increasing exponentially until I'm like the third result down on Google, when you type nothing whatsoever in the search bar, and press enter. (I am pleased with that last image, even though I think I could have probably articulated it a bit better.) My typing speed has really increased this year, and I really think that much of that increase comes from my adoption of vim, and then the subsequent transition to emacs. It turns out that if a lot of super handy commands require the number keys, and weird bits of punctuation, the lazy approach is actually to learn to touch type those. So there's that.

Music-wise, I've been listening to all sorts of stuff, though nothing particularly out of my comfort zone, so I can't say that I have anything new and thrilling to share with you. Sorry.

I am going to try and record my radio show in advance today, so that I can slack off tomorrow (by which I mean do work during the hour). I don't think that will actually end up happening, though.

I haven't read a full book in forever, and the last things I've been reading have all been nonfiction, either self-help-type stuff (though of course, not the full-blown stuff. Just stuff that has a veneer of academic or intellectual merit, and therefore, can be rationalized away, in the event of an interrogation.) or science and philosophy stuff, not too far off from my usual palette. But I want to start reading some different stuff, though I can't exactly say what it is I would want to read. I bet I would know it if I saw it. But maybe I would not.

Here's a lesson I've learned recently: 

What we call "Panic Attacks" are not qualitatively identical to anxieties, just with a vivid and evocative figurative name. No they are a different breed entirely, and they are a lot worse. I actually managed to induce one in myself this past week. I'm a little bit proud of my previously unknown capability for thinking without any grounding in the real world whatsoever, and for literally paralyzing myself with anxiety. On the other hand, I am freaked out that I could do that, and it has made me a lot more aware of the degree of my anxiety, so that I can keep myself within a manageable range. I think I also function a lot better when I have someone to bounce my ideas off of every couple of hours, before they drift away from reality, and accelerate endlessly into the realms of imagination. 

-I'll post again soon, so don't fret too much.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So why am I writing at 9:31 am in the morning? It turns out that our bathroom undergoes weekly cleaning every Monday at 9:30 am, and I am wrapped in a towel about 20 ft. from the door, waiting for the work to be done so that I can take a shower. The situation, which on the face of it, looks perfectly innocuous, is in fact fairly weird upon reflection. Why is cleaning at this strange hour? Why is this not announced ahead of time, instead of discovered by the deductive reasoning of America's future leaders?

Okay, I actually can't think of any other questionable aspects of the situation, but as of one minute ago, I am unable to shower still, and so I continue typing, killing time with the illusion of productivity as I wish I was either dressed or showering. 

Okay, I have now showered, and I'm going to wrap this post up. I know that usually I wait until I'm nearing the surface after after falling into a deep existential hole before posting, but I think that your voyeuristic tendencies have received more than enough capitulation for the time being, and so that will have to wait.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Okay, so one of the many reasons that my posts have been infrequent recently is that I have been spending all of my free time on computer science. In particular, this one assignment, which I could not, despite my best efforts, get to work. As of now, I have probably spent over 20 hours debugging it, and in the process taught myself emacs, gdb, grep, input redirection, and others. This is literally the most frustrating thing I have ever done. 

About 5 minutes ago, I figured it out. I found the bug. (Caveat: I haven't yet fixed it in the code, because I wanted to write this post first, and so there is a slight possibility it still won't work after I make the changes I am envisioning. But I am like 99% sure. Also, I will feel really stupid if it doesn't work now.) I found it. 

I feel like a superhero right now. Honestly, the sense of accomplishment that I am feeling right now is greater than I can remember ever feeling. I'm serious. 

Normally, when I have some bug that frustrates me to no end, it turns out to be something really stupid causing the problem, but in this case, the bug is actually really tricky, and comes about in such a weird way, that it is essentially impossible to determine what's causing it without knowing what the problem is in advance. 

Unfortunately, the elation is wearing off, and I am realizing that I still have to actually fix this. So that's the end of the post for now.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[It's actually really nice here in Providence, and if it were to consistently be this way, it would be awesome (at least for people who like these kinds of things), but currently it cools down and rains every other day or so, and the nights are cold and blustery. I'm actually a fan of rain, and blustery weather, but I know this preference is unusual, and so henceforth, when I discuss the weather, I shall pretend to like the same kind of weather as that preferred by my more conventional acquaintances. Wow, that sounded elitist, and pretentious, and meant it to be humorous, with a sarcastic tone. But it did not come across that way.

Anyway, so I've been reading a lot of computer science blogs, and thinking a lot about computer science, and I think I am ready to start a series on computer science again, in which I try to explain what exactly the field of computer science is, in layman's terms.

I actually should be working now, so I will keep it short, but here's the introduction:

When you think about exactly what it is that a computer does, it quickly becomes clear that there are some major limitations on the kinds of problems that computers can solve. I like to say that a computer is like an imagination machine, a device that can do anything that you can imagine, if you just program it right. But that isn't really true, and even if it were, programming it right is far from trivial. In some general sense, computers are all about handling data, about converting bits to other bits with staggering rapidity. Already, this definition restricts the type of data that can be processed to discrete quantities, or just sets of numbers, theoretically in any base though binary has killed off all alternatives (ignoring quantum computing, which is just weird.) This is a really big deal, because if you want to handle some data, you have to find a way to turn it into bit strings, and if you are trying to measure anything continuous, you have to think very carefully about how you are going to digitize it, what information you are going to lose, and how to preserve the features that are salient to you. Nowadays, systems like Mathematica abstract away concerns about the representation of numbers, but you mustn't forget that in the end you cannot be infinitely precise, any when you calculate with a number like pi, Mathematica is behind the scenes calculating to the requested precision, and then rounding. If you want more digits, Mathematica has to crank them out on the spot, since you can't just enumerate all the digits of pi. How does this come into play when using a computer? The obvious example is one that many of you are probably familiar with. You do some calculation, and round in an intermediate step, and your answer is a little bit off to drastically off, depending on the nature of the calculation. That is just the beginning, and it gets worse. I'm getting to work now, but tune in for more later.

<blockquote>Basically, the more you do CS, the more you realize that you are only doing a limited number of truly different things. Like searching, sorting, filtering, traversing, and so on... The number of times you are going to have to do binary search in some list, or that you are going to have to build some kind of linked list, or some growing array is probably dwarfed only by the number of times you are going to have to write nested loops, or getters and setters, or interface with some GUI via event listeners and callbacks and junk. The point is, given that all this stuff exists already, and is known, when you describe the stuff you are programming, you are bound to feel a little silly. And that's ok, because in CS, you do spend a couple years writing stuff that people have written countless times before, stuff which is a google search away, and which has surely been done better, and which is free of the design errors that make your work such a pain.

Ideally, you should never write a piece of code that has been written elsewhere, since you are always trying to minimize the potential for errors, and Java collections are invariably going to get fixed if they are broken, while your linked list can randomly delete links for months without anyone necessarily paying enough attention to do anything about it. 

So why do you write it over again? Well, there are a couple of reasons, which don't really do much to quiet the creeping feeling that you are wasting your time. First, in the writing of the linked list, you gain experience with some programming techniques, in this case recursion, which you need in your toolbox, and you won't be able to write recursive functions well without practice. Second, by implementing methods that you use on a daily basis in an utterly unfamiliar way, you see the true power of API's. It really is a brilliant idea, that implementations don't matter, and that if you simply specify preconditions and postconditions, you can write the rest of the program without having to know or care how the things you are interacting with actually work. 

The whole idea of an API is entirely </blockquote>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey, 

I'm back, and better than ever, a.k.a. not really bad, not that great either, about to go eat lunch, and pumped. Before I forget, I want to plug some albums that have been in heavy rotation recently. First, <em>16 Lover's Lane</em> by The Go-Betweens. It is ridiculously good, a sublime collection of gorgeous and fascinating love songs. About once a month for the last couple months, I've been falling in love with a new band. It was Spoon maybe two months ago. Last year at some point, it was the Divine Comedy. 

I don't know exactly what I should make of this insight...

Anyway, so why have I not been blogging in a while. Well, basically, I started some Comp Sci. post that I was totally unprepared to write, and as a result, I put it off for the longest time, telling myself I should wait until I have a largeish chunk of time in which I could really write something good, and not just some junk that I wouldn't be proud of publishing. But again, and I know this is beginning to get old, I'm writing this thing with no standards whatsoever, and as long as I am publishing anything, I am winning.

That being said, I am not going to publish this post, just so that I can get something published, and then I will immediately get hard at work on another one.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I can't really see anything at all, and all I can see is my reflection, cut up by the slivers of the blinds. I am in a corridor of light, and to my right the stacks are dark, though you can see straight across to the parallel corridor of light on the other side of the stacks. I think I have now worked on pretty much every different floor in the SciLi. I like it here, it is quiet, and still. Maybe it is just me right now feeling calm, as I listen to the Walkmen, with "Hang On, Siobhan". 

I have started to enjoy coding again. The satisfaction from getting something to work the way you wanted it to is incredible, and when you are able to steadily see pieces of code get assembled into a cohesive whole, you can't help but feel good. 

I like building things, and I know that whatever career I end up in, I will want to build things. This is as opposed to simply solving problems. I want to put up edifices, I want to leave myself behind in artifacts. I want to be a piece of history.

I want to be understood across decades, across generations, through a pair of headphones, or a computer screen. You know that poem by Shelley, <em>Ozymandius</em>. You're supposed to think that the contrast between the scene of the ruins, and the glorious kingdom described on the plaque reveals the insignificance of all human empires in the face of time, or something like that. You are supposed to hear "Look upon my works, ye mighty, and despair" as a statement of laughable hubris, a piece of wishful thinking, that is the more pitiable for the sand that has swallowed up every trace of the his works. And then you are supposed to despair, for the inevitability of time, and the limits of human existence. 

I don't agree with this view of the situation. I can imagine nothing greater than having a lonely traveler stumble across the colossal fallen statue that hints at empires gone by, swallowed in the sands. I want to be absorbed into the earth, remaining only as a symbol, an omen. I want to have that kind of meaning. 

Now, I'm gonna go back to work, because I should.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[See above for all actual content. 

I'm feeling anticipatory. I suddenly remembered last night how much I missed playing guitar, and I'm gonna start up again. I keep listening to the Go-Betweens. Recently I have been able to appreciate love songs for the first time. Until this point, I have always heard the lyrics of love songs as cliches, the filler used to give the singer something to do when the band can't come up with a better topic. But now I think I get them for the first time. It's really weird, because the words are the same, but suddenly I think I can understand the feelings expressed at an emotional level, and not just intellectually. The more I try to articulate this, the more ridiculous it sounds, but that doesn't make it any less true.

I realize that anyone familiar with pop psychology who reads this will immediately come to the tentative conclusion that this transformation happened because I was in love for the first time, or something along those lines; I want to stop that line of thought in its tracks before this whole conversation gets derailed. That is not the case. That's all I'm gonna say on that.

I'm now getting self-conscious about publishing this, so I think I'm gonna end it here, and maybe post again later today. 

Anyway,
Your Humble Servant, 
Spencer]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I had fun writing that title. I like amiable nonsense. 

Sweet and softly prodding jokes, you know, to knock you down off your perch, because nobody knows it all, and you certainly don't. (I'm just having some fun right now. Don't waste your time trying to parse this junk.) You're a hillbilly philosopher, a diamond in the rough, a bloody and brilliant battle fought on the riverside. There's a kind of music that reminds me of trains, a medium-tempo chugging tune, like "Lodi" by CCR. That song is playing as I compose this post. John Fogerty has a wonderful voice, a voice that avoids the histrionics of punk, and the doldrums of country, that can sing like speaking, that can explode in "Fortunate Son" and can menace in "Run Through the Jungle". I want to steal his voice. 

I haven't talked about philosophy much recently, or psychology, or much else. My interests are elsewhere at the moment. They are more grounded, in the eroded sidewalks of Benefit St., the obelisk of the Sci Li, the dusty red carpet that seems to attract bits of paper and dirt and leaves like some kind of trashy Pied Piper. Did that simile make any sense? I don't know. Sometimes I like to just flex my imagery muscles, you know, hold an image in my mind's eye, rotating around and zooming in and out and trying to remember where I saw those same curves and lines. Trying to find that unexpected connection, that invisible thread across which the experiences are connected, across which the electric current of experience runs. When it's done right, the world becomes a lot smaller, and it seems so obvious that these disparate experiences are qualitatively the same.

I wonder about the relationship between the qualitative nature and quantitative nature of things. I think Math is quantitative, but it sometimes takes on a very qualitative flavor, and some of the most abstract objects are understood qualitatively. Actually I think pretty much everything in Math is that way, and only later is the sensation made quantitative.

"History Lesson, Pt. 2" by The Minutemen. Check it out. 

I wonder if all my talk of music bores you, my imagined reader. You don't care about that shit. No, you want the juicy stuff. The love affairs and the feelings, and the way the campus feels. Do you care that the birds have started up their canon at 2am, long before the air in the halls starts to hang thick, with the dreamy sound like listening in water? Can you imagine my desk, cluttered and improbable, my shelves, spilling books like flowers spilling out from a bouquet. 

The creamy color of the walls, the weird plaster tiles that turn my ceiling into a Cartesian grid. I got lucky, and the light in our room is brighter than most, though it has recently begun to dim for a moment at a time, like the cough that foreshadows consumption. I should just go to sleep now.

This post is fun. I should do it more often. Do you want to read again next week? We can maybe grab dinner beforehand, or just take a walk in the park. That sounds, nice, yeah.

-Stella (of "Please call Stella" fame. It's an inside joke, and I find it really funny, but you should not.)]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Ok, so one of the best things about Brown University is that every day there are more interesting events going on than one could possibly attend. Yesterday, I decided on the spur of the moment to attend a seminar on Cyberwarfare and International Relations. Today, I went to a talk by Joseph Hellerstein of UCB on Bloom, a distributed computing language that is ridiculously cool. The only reason I am posting this right now is to leave a reminder to myself to check it out further, and I wanna start looking into similar work. Here's the link: <a href="http://www.bloom-lang.net/" title="Bloom Programming Language">Bloom Programming Language</a>. He showed a chat server that he wrote in Bud (the Ruby embedded language version of Bloom) which was about 20 lines across three files, mostly boilerplate to interface with the command-line and to prettyprint. In Java, I can't imagine doing this in anything viewable on a single screen. Furthermore, you can make really high-level changes with similar brevity. I was inspired, and am going to be pondering his ideas for the next couple days.

end of post.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm posting again.

Why? Because I am taking a break from programming for like 10 minutes, and I don't want to start up Bejeweled again. I am actually enjoying this a fair amount, making the GUI for WizWar, but I am getting annoyed by how much jumping around in documentation I have to do. It's going pretty well, so I have no reason to complain. 

There is a type of programming that shows up with a frustrating frequency when doing GUI work. I don't know if there is a formal name for it, but the essence of this particular species is that you spend most of your time figuring what methods the API gave you, and trying to figure what they called all of the stuff you have to use. You are not doing anything particularly complicated, and you know what you are trying to do, so the work is in figuring out how to translate your vision to the formalism of the library you are using.

This is grunt work, and doesn't actually require the same intellectual horsepower that other types of programming do. It's not that hard, so one would suspect there would be some way to automate it, and I guess GUI builders do that to some extent, but I feel like the problem has no chance of get solved in any permanent way in the near future. That fact would suggest that the problem is hard in some fundamental way, but I think all the difficulty comes from the failure on the human side to communicate the image in the mind's eye to something fully formalized.

I keep trying to spell "formalized' with an 's' instead of a 'z' because I hate the letter 'z' and because I think the British spelling is just so much more elegant. I pretty much prefer all the British spellings of words that have both a British and American English spelling. I even like 'colour', though I would be hard-pressed to defend it in an argument. 

Ok, this post is going nowhere, which probably means that I should get back to work.

  <title>At the Height of the Fighting</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[That grainy hum, the constant reminder of the immense currents of air and electricity flowing in the walls of a building. 

That simple air, that shout across the hall that stops before it even gets halfway there.

Abelson and Sussman; just got the copy I ordered, and am super excited to start reading it. 

Ok, it is now three hours later, and I am going to start working again, and I am feeling discouraged, and I really want to get myself out of this funk now, because I can't imagine spending the next couple hours until I sleep in any good way if I stay in this dark mood.

So why do I feel bad? Well, because I saw my friends as they came back from a party that looked like a lot of fun, and I wish that I had gone to. The feelings evoked: regret, failure, that unbearable knowledge that you keeping missing chances, and the certainty that you only have so many more chances. These are the thoughts: Now I talk back to them, disarm them with the truth of the matter. These dark thoughts are nothing more than the ghoulish shadows of the world, the brute fact of everyday experience dragged into horrible shapes by the gravity of my insecurities. By the time the light hits my eyes, it's already been distorted so much that the bright colors of the world appear as nothing more than brown sludge. 

Well, I just got really wrapped up in that imagery, and forgot to actually do the talking back, but here goes:

First, it is one night, one party. There will be more. Second, this does not mean anything about what I am going to do in the future. I can do otherwise in the future, and am not fated to repeat my mistakes. Third, I am not particularly comfortable at parties, and I don't think that I would have had as good a time there as I am imagining. This is not working as well as I'd hoped, and I think the reason is that I can't shake this feeling that I am doomed, fated never to be happy, treading water until my legs give out, never reaching the safety of land. And when I put it this way, I guess I just don't think it is necessarily true. I mean it feels that way, but that doesn't mean that it will end up this way. I am lovable, I am good enough. I am trying as hard as I can, and I am making progress. The fact that I feel this emotion has nothing to do with whether or not things are as bad as I feel them to be. Also, it is not like everyone else is as happy as I imagine them to be. Everyone gets down sometimes. 

Ok, it is now like 10 minutes later, and I am feeling sufficiently better again to go back to doing things other than trying to shake myself out of this mood. 

So theoretically now I would hit publish, and go onto other stuff, but I'm not sure about publishing this one. What if it is too personal, what if I regret some of the things that I say, what if a future employer were to hit upon this blog and read it, and be discouraged from hiring me?

Well, the only answer I have to that, and it is mostly argued as the devil's advocate, is that I have too little time in my life to pretend that I am different than I am, and I am tired of wasting my time caring what people think about me. The argument can be paraphrased succintly as: Fuck it. I refuse to think any more about what people think about me. I do care, and I can't just forget about it, but I refuse to let myself be that way. I know that I am a good person, a person worth loving, a person worth redeeming, a person worth hiring. If I don't let myself act as though I care about what other people think, perhaps in time, I will actually stop caring. (I don't mean that in the misanthropic "I am an Island" way, but just I don't have to be self-concious, or regard myself as anything other than okay, meant in the larger existential sense of square with the universe, owed nothing, and owing nothing. 

Ok, I got carried away there again, and this time for real, I am going to publish and log off. 

Fuck it.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So usually I have to get to "Fuck it!" from a sense of righteous anger, a sense that I am a human being, and I deserve nothing less than what any other human being deserves. 

This works fine, but it leaves a bad taste in my mouth, and makes it hard to genuinely not care, because I am daring myself to let their opinions matter, as opposed to just simply not thinking about them at all.

About 10 minutes after I published that last post, a song made me remember the other way I can come to that same conclusion. The song: "In &amp; Out in Paris &amp; London" by The Divine Comedy. The lyrics are awesome, and really sarcastic: 	  

<blockquote>It is a far far better thing that I do now than I have ever done before
It is a far far better place that I go to than I have ever known before"
My slap 'n' tickle made her giggle
Made her wiggle like a willow tree
So suggestively
So I suggested
She protested
I persisted till she said "Well, okay..."
And I said "Wey-hey!"

In or out—of one thing there can be no doubt
Out or in—this is not a sin—it's not even original!
And hey, we're all individuals—so let the games begin!

I fall in love with someone new practically every day but that's okay
It's just the price I pay for being a man (if that's really what I am)
And I refuse to take it all too seriously
It's such a strange activity,
Far too peculiar to be taken any other way
Don't wait until tomorrow—do it today

In out in out in out in out in out in out in out

Shake it all about </blockquote>

Now imagine this being sung by the Irish cross between Isaac Hayes and Ian Curtis. Anyway, the lines that I'm talking about are "And I refuse to take it all too seriously / It's such a strange activity / Far too peculiar to be taken any other way / Don't wait until tomorrow—do it today". Just to be clear, I am talking about the general sentiment, and not the particular activity he is using it to support. I always forget how absurd everything is, how insane it is that I am even here in the first place. I should have a sense of humor about myself, because I am an absurdity in an absurd universe. I am the bumbling fool, the tragicomic figure, stumbling his way through life, pushed and pulled by chance. And that's okay. Because the tramp is the hero. Because everyone roots for Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. Because to root for anything else is to say that doing your best isn't good enough, and there is no way for that to be true. So again, fuck it. 

P.P.S. The Divine Comedy hits a similar note in "Charge", which takes the <b>Love is a battlefield</b> to absurd and hillarious heights: 

<blockquote>Ladysmith wants you forthwith to come to her relief
Burn your briefs you leave for France tonight
Carefully cut the straps of the booby-traps and set the captives free
But don't shoot 'til you see her big blue eyes

Then sound the charge—breath your final breath
And charge into the valley of death
Cannon to the left and cannon to the right
They'll go bang bang bang all night

We'll fight them on the beaches
Yes, we'll fill 'em full of lead
Fighting naked in the open air
We'll fight them in the kitchen, in the bathroom in the garden shed
Fighting the good fight any-fighting-where

So sound the charge—breathe your final breath
And charge into the valley of death
Cannon to the left and cannon to the right
They'll go bang bang bang all night
There'll be a cannon to the left and cannon to the right
They'll go bang bang bang bang bang bang bang all night...

"Baby baby, I love the way you talk sense to me
Especially when you say 'Neil, you got love'
I hear what you're saying...
I have in my hand a piece of paper that says
"Let's make lurrve, not this phoney war-thang"
We goin' over the top -
But you're so sexy when you're angry, honey-chile"

"Roamin' around in no man's land, gettin' caught in your barbed wire
Baby baby, gonna set your village on fire..."

CHARGE—I'm gonna hit you where it hurts
CHARGE—So sound the red alert!
There'll be a cannon to the left...
...And a cannon to the right...
(The hills are alive with the sound of)
BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG
BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG
BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG
All night! </blockquote>

(It's like 100 times better heard than read so do it.)

Ok, now I'm really done for the day.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So,

As the title of this post may suggest, I am alternately feeling good and bad, and I know that those are the most generic descriptions possible, but I chose them, because that is all I mean to say. I don't want to say any more.

I know why, and I know why. Tomorrow is another day, and I will try again tomorrow.

Starting fresh, not feeling so very heavy anymore. 

Right now, my whole body wants to drop to the floor. My whole soul slides towards sleep. 

I am asleep.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[One cool thing that I've noticed recently is that I've acquired a much better understanding of how my mind works. I am beginning to be able to understand why I feel the way that I do, which is an incredibly useful skill to have as I can then address the root concerns instead of simply trying to power through the negative emotion. So for example, if I talk to someone, and leave feeling utterly hopeless, despondent and down, I can, after a period of sulking, walk back through the experience, and take note of the thoughts I was having at the time. And I am beginning to know what kinds of thoughts trigger the downswings, so that I can anticipate them in conversation, and come armed against them with memorized phrases. 

This is gonna be a short post because I should be working on my CS project, but maybe I'll post again later.

I am okay. I am a human being like anyone else, deserving of the same happiness. (This helps me.)

Fuck it.
Fuck it.
Deep breath.
Try not to take it all so seriously.

I don't care if I am made a fool of.
Talk to people.
Ask for help.

I just want to say I really appreciate all that my friends have done for me, and I want to make sure that they know just how much I appreciate their support. 

-A little calmer now, 

Back to work.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So I've recently been going on a Velvet Underground binge. I've always been a big fan of the Velvet Underground and Nico (a.k.a. the banana album), and I've like <em>Loaded</em> for some time now, but i recently picked up the eponymous album, and <em>White Light/White Heat</em>. I have not yet listened to the latter, but I have been listening to the former, and I'm absolutely loving it. There is a kind of calm deliberate energy to the songs, a composure that is lacking in a lot of music. It's an interesting tone to have, and I'm appreciative of how totally distinct they sound from anyone else really. 

A while back, I got a really nice set of headphones, and they make pretty much any song ten times better. There have a couple of albums that I didn't particularly like that I appreciated for the first time after hearing them in these headphones. Sound quality is a big deal to me, and every tone and timbre seems to have a different feeling to it. A lot of my favorite moments in music involve a melody straining against a pedaled harmony, over and over again trying to escape and being pulled back again. At those moments, I can feel this delightful tension, a feeling like you are surging with electricity, pulled forward, compelled forward. 

I was going to talk about CS, but I'm not really in the mood to do so right now, and I should be doing work.

One thing I have been thinking about is the fact that computer science is unique among all disciplines in that it is half natural science, and half humanity. I will discuss this more later...

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So this is going to be one of those posts in which I go on a freeform mini-rant right before I go to sleep.

So yeah.

Why am I in such a mood? Because I have a math homework due tomorrow that I have just begun, and I really want to sleep, and I can't imagine actually doing the homework.

As I wrote that sentence, I realized that I am dreading it, and I know that when I dread something, I will not let myself do it no matter what, under any circumstances. But despite the irrationality and strange psychodynamics revealed in that insight, I still cannot imagine doing it. I can intellectually say that all I have to do is break it down, step by step. Read the first problem, look up all the terms you do not know, and start seeing if you get anywhere. But I don't want to do it.

I want to go to sleep. I am tired of working for the day.

I want to start fresh tomorrow. I am trying to conjure up my maxims, but none of them are working. The fact that I am actually sitting here writing a blog post about my decision making instead of either doing the homework or going to sleep is kind of strange, and I don't know how to incorporate that into my understanding of the forces operating in me at the moment. Well, I guess it could be a way to convince myself that I am doing something productive, without doing my homework. Right, if I write this blog post, then I can prove to myself that I have accomplished something today. Furthermore, I am actively generating evidence that I can later look at to justify my choice. I can say that I thought it through.

I can say that. But will I believe it? I don't know. 

Here's what I know:

I am a good person, and that is true whether or not I do my math homework right now. I am a smart person, a kind person, a person worth loving. My math homework is not me. Circumstances are involved. Circumstances that are at least partially of my own creation. I am working at getting better though, and everyone makes mistakes. I am not any less of a human being for my mistakes. 

I shouldn't take it all so seriously anyway. 

I know what I know.

I'm turning into some kind of motivational speaker, a fucking Tony Robbins, but with more indecision, and hedging. Because at the moment, no matter how much I say of this self-confidence building junk, I don't particularly believe it.

Oh wait, but is that me using Emotional Reasoning, which is a definite cognitive fallacy? Yes. And catastrophizing as well? And mind-reading? And labeling? Yes, yes, yes to all.

And BAM, you now know Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. 

I'm tired though, and I'm gonna go to sleep.

I wanna be cozy, curled up in my bed, surrounded by blankets and pillows, and eyes closed, feeling my head heavy on the pillow.

Goodnight, 
The man with the piercing gaze, sharp as a knife, soft as a feather, gentle, graceful, kind. 

Kindness is nice.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Well usually the answer is negative. Usually any absences from the blog are due to downswings in mood, unfortunate days of feeling like it would be too much work to post.

This time, I'm happy to report, I have been feeling very good for the past two days.

For one, it was my birthday, and I had a really good one. Everyone was great, and made me feel tremendously loved, which was awesome. Let me just say: You guys don't know how much your support means to me, and I can't thank you enough. You are awesome.

Two, life's good these days.

One negative note in an otherwise nice week: I think that depressive imagery, and the fixated ruminations of depression probably make for better blog material, as it is really hard to come up with interesting ways for things to go right. Anyway, I'll be back with actual thoughts and such tomorrow, but for now, just letting you know that I'm good, you're good, and it's all good.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been thinking a lot recently about who my heroes are. For someone to be a hero to me, they must be fundamentally good, fundamentally concerned with the well-being of human kind, fundamentally kind to others. I can only think of a few people who fit that criterion, and I am on the fence about some of them. Maybe the only person who I truly believe is as good a person as can be is Mr. Rogers. Watch this clip: [youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXEuEUQIP3Q]. I love everything about this clip.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Well,

I did just have finals, an ordeal which included 30 hours without sleep, a surprise exam discovered with two hours notice, an adventure upon a roof, much rumination, a moving day that converted me to asceticism as regards material comforts, a series of bittersweet goodbyes, a round of self-recrimination as I realized I was one-fourth of the way done with college, and had completed so little of what I had wanted to this year. I'm really can't wait to be back next year, to do things differently. 

That's why the blog has been dormant lately. Now, I'm free. I'm in LA, I'm made of time (not really, I'm actually still really busy), and I have lots of stored up material to share with the world (or whatever fraction of it visits this blog), and so you should expect a torrent, a veritable eruption of content in the next weeks. But now I have to do some more work. Yeah, I know. Sorry.

Be back soon,
S.]]></content:encoded>

Look, I'm writing right now. Just putting words on the page. Typing. Just took a nap.

Now listening to the Futureheads do "Hounds of Love", which is one of those few songs that seems to be able to make me feel a little bit better whenever I am feeling the least bit down. Not that I am feeling down right now so much as deflated. I guess I am just tired, beat down, weary. 

When I start using synonyms like mad, you know that I am tired. Or something. 

I'm gonna publish this now, because I want to get the habit back, even if I don't have the content behind the posts yet.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Belle and Sebastian at times seems to me to be so perfect that it is almost impossible. Like in the song whose title I stole for the title of this post.  I cannot believe how perfect that song it is, how it seems to keep rising, and rising, and just pulls you up so much, pulls you upright, grabs you by the throat. They have some ways of arranging a song, where there is kind of this shimmery background that seems to flutter and twirl in perfect complement to the vocals, its not thick but it swirls up and around and makes every song glorious and wonderfully complex. I'm surprised at how they seem to have few imitators even after a decade of acclaim and indie success. I can't really think of a band that sounds much like them, but I haven't looked very hard, and this is just a gut feeling.

Anyway, so I'm gonna talk about other stuff for once. LIke books. Read <i> Pattern Recognition </i> by William Gibson, thought parts of it were totally great, while other parts seemed to be just ordinary, stuff that anyone could have written, lacking that distinctive Gibson feel. Then again, he can sometimes write the hell out of a passage, hitting you with a description that is so apt that you can't believe that you hadn't thought of it before, and which you are now can't imagine not having read. I'm kinda going overboard here, but I'm rusty, and trust me, I'll get good when I start getting to the emotional stuff, cause that has been my focus over the past few weeks. 

Here goes nothing, besides another shot at maybe having a normal sleep schedule, and maybe some of my privacy, and maybe some of my emotional energy, and maybe some chance to reflect more before dumping my rough-edged thoughts on the world: Yeah, anyway. 

How am I feeling? Why do you care? Who are you? Are you there? Who is John Galt? &lt;----- I wrote that and then decided that it was tacky, but in the spirit of uninhibited honesty and whatever, I will leave it there, and just cringe whenever I read this post. But I guess now that I wrote this, I won&#039;t? Who knows? 

Listening now to CYHSY, their second album, which is pretty good in my humble opinion, and deserves a little more respect than it got. I wonder what they are up to now? (Actually, I could find out in an instant if I went to Wikipedia, and I will do that after I finish this parenthetical.) Ok, the answer is that they are working on their long awaited third album, but were so quiet that people wondered if they had actually broken up, and they had to make a video in which they reassured their fans that they were indeed alive and well. 

Yeah, so here is what I am feeling: I am weary, want to be finally done with CS, as I&#039;ve had to keep working on this project which has been taking forever, and it has been making it hard for me to focus on relaxing and since I leave in less than a week for Providence, I don&#039;t really have that much time to relax, and I really gotta cram this relaxation in before I lose the opportunity. Also, I&#039;m apart from basically all my friends, and I would ideally like to relax with friends, so not being able to do that is frustrating.

But I am feeling okay about myself, in the sense of I believe that I am a decent human being, with his fair share of faults, but a decent heart, and easygoing enough to cause people to like me and enjoy my company. Which is to be honest, not the normal state of affairs, and so this plateau is kind of an achievement to be valued and whatever. 

I keep having to resist the tendency to end my sentences with a piece of slacker vernacular, perhaps because that way I can project onto these sentences a sort of detachment and half-hearted irony that will keep people from thinking that they truly know me, and will allow me to disavow my own words should the situation ever devolve to that. 

Interesting point: Imagine that I am in fact a very sophisticated stochastic simulation, designed to generate plausible blog content, at plausible blog intervals, on a suitable site, with content that seems plausible and perhaps almost meaningful, but is in reality the bullshit that you get when you average like all blog posts ever on the internet, and then throw in a little bit of personality and quirk by letting in some rarer nouns, and maybe giving me some sentence patterns that are not exactly normal, but pretty darn close. Who would guess that my charming and humanizing idiosyncrasies are really the product of a artificial-intelligence-industrial complex run amok, in the lawless Wild West that is the Bay Area. The elaborate machinations of fresh ivy-league CS grads, eager to get in on the action while it is still hot, to not have to read about yet another billionaire start-up founder who doesn&#039;t seem like all that, just a sharp-witted kid with a knack for programming, but devoid of any deep intellect. Projecting much? Well, since I hate rhetorical questions, I will answer. Yes, I am projecting, and yes, I sometimes do feel like the Mark Zuckerbergs or whoevers that are on the cover of about one TIME magazine per month just aren&#039;t really all that special. And I guess with only their track record to go by, I am entirely unjustified in making that assertion, but I make it nonetheless, because it feels true, and in the end that is all you have. Okay, I am gonna publish here, and immediately continue, just so it looks like I have two unrelated posts, and so people don&#039;t get too intimidated by the length. 

TO BE CONTINUED IMMEDIATELY ABOVE,
-Spencer, Lord of Darkness, King of the Florida Keys, Destroyer of Worlds, Headphone Connoisseur, Unrecognized polymath and great guy, Probably would be a great boyfriend too, not that I get that question a lot. (Oooooh, the resentment rides high tonight.) &lt;--- Subtle Joy Division reference there, though I guess I just gutted the subtlety from the poor thing.  ]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[That is the song I am listening to at this very moment. Good shit. Cursing to make myself seem edgy.

Anyway as I was saying in the post preceding this one, which was abruptly ended for reasons that are lost to me, I don't think many tech entrepreneurs are really that smart. But I cannot really think of many people that I think I would be totally comfortable saying are really smart, as I kind of think that beyond a certain level of intelligence, everyone is capable of getting everything, and to be honest, it is hard to see how anyone could really convince someone that they were smarter in a way that was more than just a magic show, or a demonstration of superior short term memory or processing speed or whatever. 

Aside: How did we talk about thinking before computers? How did we think about computation before computers? Did we think about this shit? I should probably know the answers to those questions at least in a vague sense, given my areas of interest, but I am too tired to cross my room, and go find out, and I am really in the zone now, with a wpm rivaling that achieved when typing stuff like my name and test data in programs that I am debugging. I can now type "Thayer St, George St, Brown St, Angell St" faster than maybe any other string of that same length, though I intentionally used that string to practice my utilitzation of the right shift key, which had been sadly neglected for pretty much ever. Like, I would just always use the left shift, even when I was capitalizing words that started with letters that were typed with my left hand. I'm working on it, and it's getting better.

Actually my typing has gotten a lot better this year, as I've been making a point of doing small things differently every time, trying to fix one bad habit a day, for a few minutes, and letting muscle memory do its thing. I'm pretty sure I've blogged about this before, but whatever. It's my blog, I can do what I want!

Yeah, anyway, I am gonna go to sleep now, because I am intensely aware of my bed about 8 feet away from me, just laying there, asking for me to sleep in it. I was trying to turn that into some kind of sly suggestion, and I don't know whether I succeeded. I am hungry now, which sucks, cause I should really sleep. 

Too much solipsism in this post. I hollowly promise to do otherwise in the future. Look into my eyes. Do you trust me? Even if you do, I don't trust you. Bummer. It's not you, it's me. You see I don't really trust anyone all that much. Just like Kanye, I too can't handle the intimacy, and the look in your eyes is killing me. I probably misquoted that. 

Nighty nighty, 
Signing off to the soothing sounds of The English Beat. 
-Slimy sludge, slippery stairs, smiling faces, smashed watermelons, seeds like stars, strewn across the universe like glitter in a third grade classroom. glitter in the dark of space. Space Jam. Signatories all to the Treaty of Versailles. And we all know how well that worked out, you know what I mean? Fuck it.

  <title>How to get Started Programming on Mac OS X</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the most daunting challenges to a would-be programmer is figuring out how to get the necessary tools on his or her computer, and then figuring out how to use them to get started compiling (or interpreting) and then running programs. While most people who have been programming for a while take these kinds of skills for granted, there is a lot to learn at the beginning, and in my experience, there aren't many good resources that give a bigger picture of what it is like to actually deal with programming on a computer in a sufficiently general manner. Most teaching books will cover the tools for one language only, and in a step-by-step way that doesn't provide any understanding of what's going on. So here's my attempt to fix that gap.

<strong>Know your environment:</strong>

I am focusing on Mac OS X, because that is what I program in, but the ideas here should be applicable particularly to Linux systems, and with some modifications to Windows.

First things first: Open the Terminal. The Terminal is an application, and starts off in the Applications folder, in the sub-directory called Utilities.

You should see a new window open up, with a few lines of black text in a sea of white. The last line of text should say something like:
<pre>FirstName-LastName's-Mac:~username$</pre>
This line is going to become very familiar to you, and it is comprised of two parts. The text before the colon is the name of the computer, which someone specified when it was first configured. It will be the same so long as you are working at that computer, but if you work on other computers you can see some other names. Anyway the important part is after the colon. Immediately following the colon is a tilde, and generally that's where you are going to see your current location, also known as the working directory. Following that the username is displayed of the user who initialized this particular instance of the terminal. Almost always, this is going to be whichever user is currently logged in, so it should be your username. The last symbol on the line, a dollar sign, is there mostly just to signal the end of the line, and you can ignore its meaning for now.

Ok, so back to the tilde. The tilde is one of four special symbols that represent special locations on computer. It stands for the home directory of the current user. Directories are going to be very important, so understanding how they work is very important. Directories are essentially folders, and so the tilde is your home folder. All of the information on a Unix based system (like Mac OS X or Linux) is stored in directories and files inside those directories. Directories can be located within other directories, and in fact the entire filesystem is contained in another special directory, known as the root directory, which is often represented with a single forward-slash '/'. It's name comes from envisioning the file-system as a tree, where each directory is a branch, the root being the trunk and roots, and all the directories it contains being branches off from the trunk. The two remaining special directories are represented by a single dot, '.' and a double dot '..', and they can be read as this directory and this directory's parent directory, respectively. At the moment, since we are in the user's home directory,  '.' can be replaced with '~' without changing anything.

But this is not always true. And this is because '.' and '..' describe locations relatively, while '~' and '/' describe absolute locations. No matter where you are, if you type a forward-slash you are referring to the root directory, but the meaning of '.' is different for every single directory. The symbol for the parent directory, '..', is also a relative location since the parent of this directory is going to depend obviously on what this directory is. The parent is the directory that contains the directory that you are currently in. Since all directories are held in the root directory, if you keep tracing back parent directories, you will always end up at the root. Who is the parent of the root? Well, it turns out if you try to go to the parent of the root, you will stay at the root, but this doesn't really mean that the root is it's own parent, just that has no parent to go to .

Next up, we learn some commands and learn about the shell! Exciting stuff, I know.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[The title has a unique origin story. Basically, about a minute ago, I was trying to come up with a title for this blog post, and I couldn't think of anything and so I looked at my desk and saw that there was a stuffed lion on it, and a comb. And the rest is history. Or science. Or philosophy. Naww, I'm just playing, dawg.

What's up with me? Well, I'm feeling okay, just a little tired, since my sleep schedule is once again out of whack. I am feeling smart and competent though, and that's relatively rare. I am feeling like I could walk into a room and everyone in it would fall in love with me, because of my winning personality. I am gonna say that that last sentence was sarcastic, because I can imagine that some people would not take kindly to those kinds of assertions.

I guess I am good though. In a little bit of a holding pattern, until I head back to RI. Not sure what to do with myself, what to do with my time. So I end up wasting it all on my computer, listening to music. Which is not really wasting it, I know, cause time spent having fun, or whatever, isn't wasted , but I am spending the time wondering what I should be doing with all the free time I have right now, and so I'm not even really relaxing.

I don't know. These days I feel like life isn't really that hard, and that I can get to where I want to be just by keeping it up, like I'm already at where I need to be to handle adulthood. That's a weird thought to me: I don't particularly feel like an adult, though, having a beard, I get treated as an adult in public. I remember reading somewhere that someone was shocked to realize that adults weren't any smarter than kids, and that they didn't know anything that kids didn't. I remember the person recounting this story was really messed up by this. Like they thought that the people who were teaching them, and the people who were actually running the world were better in some way, so that they could feel safe letting them have control. But no, they're all the same as kids, just bigger. I believe it. Of what I've seen, I have no reason to think adults are any better than anyone else at anything. Then again, I think pretty much everyone has trouble handling their life.

I really wish that I knew someone who I looked up to totally, who I believed had it all right, so that I could think that maybe it was possible to get it right. But at the moment, I can't think of anyone.

Been listening to the Stones a lot recently, rediscovering their brilliance. I'd never listened closely to any of their albums, really, just loved their hits, and I finally took the time to listen to all of their best albums straight through, and I was blown away. I think <em>Let It Bleed</em>, <em>Exile on Main Street</em>, and <em>Sticky Fingers </em>are my favorites, though <em>Beggar's Banquet</em> and <em>Some Girls</em> are excellent as well. This is the first time that I've really listened to their deeper cuts, and I've found them to be awesome as well. Particularly "Salt of the Earth", a beautiful and haunting anthem to the under-appreciated hard-working common people. Apparently, according to Wikipedia, it has only been performed in concert 6 times ever by the Stones, once after 9/11. I love that they have this special song, that they make this song something more, something meaningful by playing it only very infrequently. It's like they are saying that they don't want to make it just another song, but that they want to treasure it, keep it sacred and protected.

Last thought before I slumber:

I can't think of anything more powerful than the sound of a chorus coming in at the chorus, the swell of voices, the rush of knowing you're not alone, you're not alone, the way that the universe seems to teem over with life, everything vibrating to the beat, feeling that cosmic pulse, that sublime joy.

That wonderful sprawl across lands and time, like paint flung from a brush, like a car crash, like an untamed lawn, like the smash of a screen as it explodes off the ground, sparks flying everywhere, flames licking houses like in a musical. The way the curtains swish back on forth on beat, the way the lights gyrate. The trumpets aimed at the sky above, blasting out warnings like missiles through the night. A strand of DNA in sky writing, a name on a grain of rice, a family photo gathering dust over the fireplace.

You know what I mean. You know it. I'm beginning to wonder why. I don't believe so much sometimes. I'm losing it here, in the day, before it comes back as night falls. Stars come out, and I'm shaking again, shivering with excitement, wild-eyed, and bloodthirsty. Rumors. Spread, around, this town. Like a hula-hoop, like a kite, like a beach ball bouncing through a baseball stadium. The nauseous way you stare straight up as it comes closer, pushing through the sky, blocking everything else out, and your hand comes up, and a slight sound, and it's flying through the air, and voices erupt beside you, and your head is spinning, and you suddenly feel giddy for the first time in a long long time.

-Stuck, struck like a match, goodnight.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Just sitting here, trying to resist the ever tightening grip of sleep. Good day, but busy. I am tired, and I have so much more I still want to do tonight. But I guess that I've done enough for one day, and I should go to sleep. One thought: Providence is a very sleepy town, not that it's a bad thing. It is very comfortable, very livable. But it feels underpopulated. I always feel like it could handle like double the population without a problem. But maybe that's just what most towns are like, and I am just used to Los Angeles, which is abnormally alive at all times. Whatever.

Goodnight.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[If you just got here, start with <a href="/2011/05/30/how-to-get-started-programming-on-mac-os-x/" title="How to get Started Programming on Mac OS X">Part 1</a>.

Ok, so last time I got started explaining what the filesystem looks like when you're in the Terminal application, but I kinda forgot to explain what exactly the terminal is. The window that you have open is called a terminal window, and it is currently running a shell: In this case, the shell is Bash. What is a shell? A shell is an interface with the operating system, that runs in a terminal. One way of thinking about it is a shell is like a window into the operating system, and each shell is built a slightly different way, so that different parts of the operating system are accessible to you from each shell, and they each show things from a slightly different angle. A terminal is a window that offers text-based interaction with a computer. Before the advent of the GUI, terminals were the only way of interacting with computers, but they are still used today when more control is desired over your computer than a GUI is able to provide. While this may not make all that much sense right now, you'll see how you can do the same things you would do with the GUI in the terminal in less time, and you can do all sorts of things that you can't really do with the GUI.

Bash, by the way, is the most popular shell right now, but there are people who prefer others (like zsh or tcsh). Each shell comes with its own set of commands and syntax, and some shells allow you to use various programming languages as part of regular actions, as opposed to just in scripts, or programs that are run.

So you have a terminal open, running the bash shell, and you are located in your home directory. To actually do something you have to learn some commands. The two most important commands at the beginning are going to be 'cd' and 'ls'. 'cd' stands for "change directory" and is used to move around the filesystem. 'ls' is short for "list" and it lists the contents of directories, with the ability to specify more or less information in the listing. Both of these commands can be used with or without any arguments (words following the command that further specify what the command does), though 'cd' does nothing without any arguments. try it now: type 'cd' in after the dollar sign on the first line (where a blinking cursor should already be), and press enter on your keyboard. The same line should now be printed again and the cursor should move down to the end of that line. What happened? You told the terminal to change the directory you were in, but didn't specify a new directory, so it just left you in the current directory, and then printed the next line, meant to indicate the current state of the terminal, and since nothing changed since the command was executed, the state is unchanged, and the same line is printed.

Now try 'ls' without any arguments.  A list of directories and maybe some files should appear below the line, and then the same status line should  be printed again. If this were all that these commands could do, they would pretty useless, but with both you can add directories as arguments and the commands will apply their functionality to the specified directories. So try typing in 'ls /' and you will receive a listing of the directories contained in the root. Type in 'ls .' and you will receive a listing of the directories contained in this directory, or the same as typing 'ls' with no arguments. To specify other directories, you provide a path to them.  A path is just a string that shows the command-line where something is located, either relative to the current working directory, or absolutely. (By the way, I forgot to mention this, but if you ever are unsure what the current working directory is, use the command 'pwd', which is short for "print working directory" to see the working directory.) Here are some example paths with explanations of how to understand them (It's not that hard to get the hang of this quickly):

<code>/usr/local/</code>

This says "start at the root directory", because of the opening forward slash, and "then go to the directory called 'usr' inside of that, and then go to the directory called 'local' inside of that".
In general forward slashes are used to separate directories, though an opening forward slash always means the root directory.

<code>/usr/local/../bin/</code>

This says "start at the root, and go to 'usr', and then go to 'local' inside that, and then go back to the parent of the current directory, which is 'usr', so go back to 'local'. Finally, go the 'bin' directory from 'usr'". Paths can get very complicated and they can go up or down an arbitrary number of directories, but in practice, you probably won't be dealing often with anything that complicated. 

<code>~/Documents</code>

This says "start at my home directory, and then go to 'Documents' inside of that". Note that I chose not to include a trailing slash in this case. It doesn't matter for these purposes whether or not you include one. 

<code>Documents/works_in_progress</code> 

The previous paths have all been absolute, since they specified the starting location, and so if you were to run 'cd' with any working directory and any of those paths, the results would be the same. This one on the other hand, because it doesn't start with an absolute location, it is assumed to be describing a location relative to the current working directory. So if I was in "~", then this would be the same as:
<code>~/Documents/works_in_progress</code>. However, if I were in '/usr/', then this would be <code>/usr/Documents/works_in_progress</code>. Be careful when specifying paths to be clear whether or not you are using a relative path or an absolute path. 

Finally: <code>../usr/</code> 

This says to go up to the parent of the current directory, and then from there go down to 'usr'. If I were in '/bin/', I would end up in '/usr/'. 

This is about all there is to know about how to get around the shell, and remember to use 'pwd' and 'ls' to help figure out a) where you are, and b) where you can go from there, respectively. 

So why is this important?  Because the GUIs that you will see if you use Eclipse or Netbeans are just wrappers around information that is all available from the command-line. So if anything isn't working there, you want to be able to go to the command-line and see exactly what it is that these programs are seeing. Furthermore, if you are installing a new language or debugger or something, to do it correctly, you are going to want to handle it from the command line. 

This is about as much as I want to cover the command-line, but if anyone requests anything in particular, I will try my best to oblige. 

For further information on the command-line, here are some resources you should check out:

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://linuxcommand.org/index.php" title="LinuxCommand - a guide to using the shell" target="_blank">LinuxCommand.org</a></li>
	<li>I've found this book to be a nice reference to carry around: <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596006280" title="O'Reilly's Linux Pocket Guide" target="_blank">Linux Pocket Guide</a></li>
	<li>Any questions particular to Bash can be answered here: <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#Top" title="Bash Reference Manual" target="_blank">Bash Reference Manual</a></li>
</ul>

Last tips: Any system that is built on Unix (which Mac OS X is) comes with documentation that can be reached from the command-line with the command 'man'. It is a little tricky to figure out how to navigate the man pages at first, so you might want to try entering 'man man', which gets you the page of the manual that describes the manual a little bit. Once inside the man pages, you can quit by pressing 'q' and scroll down with the spacebar. The man pages are displayed with the command 'less' by default, and it has its own set of controls, which can be found by pressing 'h' at any time when it is running.

An alternative way to get information, is the well-named 'info' command which opens up an interactive info reader program, from which you can learn about pretty much anything you need. Instructions are available at the top to get started.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So earlier today, by like three hours, I was on a train, hurtling Southeast at a fabric-of-reality-warping 30 or so miles per hour on the commuter rail from Boston, and I was so incredibly bored, and lazy, that I thought the very best thing to do was to write a blog post, on my phone, whilst on the train. One thing lead to another, and I was on a creative roll, spitting out new ideas like they were cherry pits and I was eating a lot of cherries (?), just smashing through all creative barriers with a hammer of inspiration, and the help of many years of erosion in the barriers due to poor rain-proofing on the part of the previous owner. 

No, but for real, I had one kind of interesting idea, which was in fact inspired by my special East Coast Commuter Rail post. That idea: Extreme blogging, in which you attempt to post in exceedingly dangerous or unusual locations, and since you are really extreme, you strive to put yourself in as much mortal peril as you can muster, so that the post is super super extreme and awesome. I know that I can definitely check off blogging from a ski lift, ski slope, plane, and cab without too much difficulty in the next year, but these are just the tip of the iceberg, and I can think of way cooler ways to blog: In an active volcano, in space, underwater, whilst skydiving, during a bank robbery, from a roof, in the arctic, while scaling the face of Mt. Rushmore. 

Anyway, I'm going to Dunkin' Donuts, which, as everybody knows, is what America runs on. Also Starbucks. 

Fun fact before I conclude this post: Did you know that in the great state of Texas, Texans consume for sustenance and enjoyment 10-gallon hats. 

Bye bye, dedicated readership. Thanks for all the fan mail, and I'll have you know that my staff is going through every one of your letters, and forging my signature on a form response. I, in fact, do not run on Dunkin' Donuts. I run on fan mail. 

Goodbye, sweet readership,
from your humble servant, and intellectual leader,
Spencer.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello,

I spent so much time coming up with the title for this post that I kinda forgot what I had planned for the content.

Here's what I do remember: First, I was going to worry out loud about the frequency of posting, so as to make myself feel less guilty for spamming the inboxen of my readers, without whomse (I compromised between the two equally wrong sounding choices of whose and whom) loving care and support I would be merely a hollow shell of a blogger, devoid of passion, insight, or other things which make one more than a hollow shell of a blogger. 

And the other route I had mapped out for this post? Well, basically, so I sent a message to someone, and received a message that was longer and more intimate in tone than my opening move. Well, inspired and emboldened by this seeming honesty and intimacy, I added a third message in which I accepted the subtle offer to move the conversation in a deeper direction, responding at the same level of intimacy and openness I was received with. My message was longer, continuing a chain unbroken of messages of increasing length, monotonic, for those of you who enjoy using mathematical and technical words in contexts where they don't exactly apply yet could be defended reasonably on the basis of being the mathematical analogue to an informal concept. Anyway the response I received was shorter than mine. That felt bad. I know it shouldn't. I should fix that.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Okay, I have confession to make: I wasn't exactly sure what I wanted to cover today, and I am going to probably just talk about a handful of disparate topics that I think might be helpful. Again, if you would like info on anything that I fail to cover here, just let me know, and I'd be happy to oblige as best I can.

Anyway, let's get started. So last time I finished up introducing the command-line and I tried to motivate it a bit, but I didn't have any concrete examples so I don't know how much of a sense you've gotten of how it's used in a day-to-day workflow. To remedy that, I'm going to give myself some tasks I want to accomplish, and I'll show you the process I use to get that done. 

Task 1: Set up Haskell on my computer so that I can play around with it, see how I like it.

If I didn't know any better, I would probably start by googling Haskell, and seeing what info was provided on the official language website. But I, and now you, know better, and we're going to do something entirely different. The reason that I don't recommend this approach to most people is that to achieve full integration of the language with your environment is a little tricky and requires some knowledge of the way that the shell works that is extraneous to the end goal of being able to program in Haskell. 

What we're going to do instead of going to the Haskell website is use a really useful piece of free open-source software called Homebrew. Homebrew is a package manager, which is a utility program that provides a set of standardized routines that can be used to manage other software on a computer. The concept of a package manager originates on Linux systems, though it is a pretty universal idea. You have a computer. You want to install a calendar application. There are immediately a bunch of questions that you have to answer to get that done. Where do you install the application? Do I need to have anything else installed for it to work properly? How do I know that this program isn't already installed on this computer, and that I just haven't seen it? What do I download to get this working right? Where do I find it? 

While none of these questions are individually that difficult to answer, ]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I always hate Sunday nights. The week is closing in, and you know that your time is running out. Soon, you'll be limited in time and place again. You feel the possibility space shrinking with a speed that is unmatched the rest of the week. 

I'm a little annoyed because I wrote like 500 hundred words for the next installment of my Mac programming series, only to have them all lost when I tried to actually publish the post. I was able to finish them only by keeping in mind the relief I would feel when I got the work off my chest. And then I actually succeeded, only to be utterly defeated just when I thought I could let myself think I won. 

I'm kinda exaggerating, but I am more than a little bit aggravated. Also, I wasn't all that pleased with the quality of what I'd written, and I was glad to be able to publish it and not have to worry about it anymore. But now, I'm gonna feel obligated to do a better job, when all I want to do is move on. I don't know, when I eventually do write it, it probably will be better, but at least for the time being, I'm annoyed. 

Listening this very moment to "Everything You've Done Wrong" by Sloan off <em>One Chord to Another</em>, a lovely pop song with a lovely message. The narrator tells his lover that he will be waiting for her to do the time for all the things she's done wrong, and that she shouldn't doubt his love. He tells himself as well that he knows she loves him. He says to her "Don't hide yourself away .../... Do your time, and pay the price .../... Don't believe that no one cares, 'cause we're here waiting baby .../... Do your time, and then come home for good." Acceptance is a virtue that at the moment matters a lot to me, and I love the idea of knowing that you may mistakes and may do wrong, but that you never have to despair. You're not off the hook, but you have not lost anything irrevocably. If you do your time, and pay your price, you will find your loved ones waiting for you when you're done. 

I also love revue-style horns in pop songs, and they are employed beautifully in this one. If you don't know what I mean by those, think of "Got to Get You Into My Life", which is the canonical example. I think the Jam use this effect in some of their songs, though I'm not sure. That reminds me: Check out "Down in the Tube Station at Midnight", one of their finest songs, and an interesting one musically and lyrically. It has a strange pre-chorus that goes on longer than one would expect. I like it a lot. When they were at their peak, the Jam just had this knack for catchy, punchy pop songs that was unparalleled. Also, they did a lot with a little, in terms of instrumentation. 

I'm beginning to feel better now, though I'm not sure exactly why. Listening to "That's Entertainment", a gem of a song, a perfect three-and-a-half minutes.

The more I listen to music, and the more I experience different genres, and different styles, I find that everything becomes pop music. It is the language in which I eventually judge all music, the tongue in which all things are seen to be the same. The best of every genre takes the ideals of pop music and translates it into native language, adding a tone that is unique to the genre. Think about it this way: Every songwriter thinks that they are writing music that will stick in the heads of their listeners, that will pull them along into its current. They think their listeners will wonder why they hadn't heard that before, will believe that they haven't actually heard anything new, but rather that they are simply recalling an old melody that had been forgotten, one buried so deep in their memory that they must have known it forever, must've known it in their very DNA. 
No one thinks they are writing experimental, inaccessible music. This isn't always true. There are always people who see this formal system, and just have to know what happens when they give the structure a push. But even then, all but the most tenacious of the formalists try to weave their experiments into the fabric of their songs like a contrast lining that makes the elegance of the rest even more apparent. Was Lou Reed trying to do this with <em>Metal Machine Music</em>, or had he long abandoned notions of listenability? I don't know. But whenever people comment on music being abrasive or unpleasant to listen to, I am convinced that there is pattern in the squalor, that they are looking it wrong. In my view, good music can come in any form, and that bad music is music that doesn't move you, that stares blankly back at you when you look at it, instead of talking to you, instead of taking your hand, and inviting you to join it in conversation.

I'm using a lot of figurative language, but I think you'll know what I mean, cause I can't think of a better way to express it. 

This is the end of this post. 

But I'll be back.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello to all my fans worldwide,

First off, I just want to let all of you who visit my site advance notice about a special international tour I'm going on. I'm going to Italy later, yes. It's true, and I have the vague logistical knowledge to make any claims of that sort plausible, if not to convince you immediately. Why should you know now? Because I am going to performing three nights when I am there, and I want to give my most loyal supporters the chance to snap up tickets before the general public gets its grubby fingers all over them. They go on sale in exactly one week for the whole world, but until then they are yours only, my disciples. To get them, you must believe. That is all.

I'd be remiss If I said that all was fine and dandy. I'd be remiss to say otherwise. For the thing is, I am on a rollercoaster, one moment wind rushing alongside me, keeping me cool in the sticky heat, one moment nauseous, eyes darting nervously under eyelids squeezed shut, trying not to think about the ground. By this I mean to say only that I am good and bad, alternating throughout the day, and its keeping me on edge, cause I won't know what I'll be like an hour from now.

But it isn't that bad. Life's good, the world's been good to me. It welcomes me with arm outstretched, before turning away and heading back into the house. It beckons for me to follow. I feel like the only thing that is constant, is that texture, the rough realism that marks the present, utterly missing in the past or future. Dreams don't have that. Memories don't have that.

I've been getting ahead on things for once in my life. I've been considering my post-collegiate ennui recently, wondering where, in retrospect, I will say, this is where it all went wrong. Right here, I had a choice, and I chose the wrong thing, chose the path of cowardice, of safety. There, I will say, is my whole life in a microcosm. That moment tells you all you need to know. I've been reading a genre of literature that is defined by its protagonist, a young man, failing to live up to his expectations, wildly intelligent, but unable to realize his potential, looking back at his life, and constructing a tragic history. The rage of youth has faded, and in its stead is a deep cynicism, a calloused soul. 

Here is what I think it is: Tenderness. That's what is missing. That's all that's needed. I really do believe that, and so it bothers me when I seem to be absolutely devoid of it. I'm far too susceptible to the glow of righteous anger, and I let its heat envelop me, make me a beacon in a dark night, giving me a strength I thought I'd never know, and only later do I realize that everyone has left, that they gave up after getting burned when trying to approach. 

Metaphor. Simile. New Order. Wilco. Bernard Sumner. New Order is an eerily neutral band, and their appeal is mostly in their texture, their driving mix, their restless up-and-down. I think the essence of the band is restlessness, the uneasy buzz of too much caffeine. Though sometimes they hit a higher note, go to a different place, a calmer place, and make some very powerful music. At least to me.

There's a kind of song I miss these days, a straightforward song that speaks plain and clear and asks nothing of you. I can romanticize everything. That's the kind of thing I write with no expectations of being understood. This is the kind of post I make with no expectation of being understood. 

Wait! "Bizarre Love Triangle" is on! I must go! Be back later,

See ya, 
Squeezebox]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Yeah, I heard this song, and was struck by how wonderful it was:

"Something so Right" by Paul Simon



<blockquote>You've got the cool water
When the fever runs high
You've got the look of lovelight
in your eyes
And I was in crazy motion
Til you calmed me down
It took a little time
But you calmed me down

When something goes wrong
I'm the first to admit it
I'm the first to admit it
But the last one to know
when something goes right
Well it's likely to lose me
It's apt to confuse me
It's such an unusual sight
I can't get used to something so right
Something so right

They've got a wall in China
It's a thousand miles long
To keep out the foreigners
They made it strong
I've got a wall around me
You can't even see
It took a little time
To get to me

Chorus

Some people never say the words
I love you
It's not their style
to be so bold
Some people never say those words
I love you
But like a child they're longing
to be told

Chorus</blockquote>

The lyrics really resonate with me right now. Just listen to it.

One more thought: The following song, "One Man's Ceiling is Another Man's Floor" is amazing, but also one of the weirdest pieces of pop music I can recall ever hearing. It's like 8 songs mashed into one.

Goodnight.
Spencer.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I don't really have all that much to say but I just thought that I should post something, rather than nothing. I am upset because I realized that I am limited continually by fear, that I am constrained by fear, that my world is like twelve times smaller than it has to be because of this stupid wall of fear that I don't even realize doesn't have to be there. 

Here's a thought: I should be able to take whatever I want, I should be able to do whatever I want to. To be poetically vague, continually playing through my head are images of possible presents, of possible branches that the now can take. Not implausible stuff, like I'm walking and the person approaching me can either look at me or choose to fiddle with his or her phone. Both of these are conceivable, and this happens all the time, but I am envisioning myself doing different things. Often I will see a behavior in one of these clips that I don't end up doing, and given that the physics aren't preventing me from actualizing my vision, it seems stupid to not ever make the decision that I want to in any of those cases. 

And the fact that I so often choose against my desires suggests that something is getting in my way, and that something is fear. I am afraid of everything, of everyone, and when I start to get afraid (and yes, I don't mean nervous, at least not as far as I can tell, but actually afraid) I am suddenly struck by powerful drive to get away from my fears, to get out of the situation as fast as I possibly can.

But I don't think of it as a factor in my decision, and that's the problem. If it were a regular factor to my decision-making faculties, I could then actually rationally combat it, consider how much better I would feel for having conquered my fears, and decide to go for whatever is causing the fear.

But because it doesn't even get to that stage of thinking, and instead the fear short-circuits, and just becomes something that I must end, I end up doing basically whatever it takes to get out of the situation that is scaring me. My options are limited to figuring out some way of reconceptualizing the situation so that I don't fear it as much, or get out immediately. Neither works very well, and the problem is that I am unable to get past the fear, only remove it. I never get the experience of living with it, and growing accustomed to its gentle presence in the background, so that I am able to gradually increase the range of experience that I am ok with, so that eventually the things that scare me are to me no longer scary.

Things just keep scaring me. That's a problem. What types of things am I referring to when I say that things scare me? Well, I'm in a little bit of a belligerent mood, so I'm gonna not answer that question. Don't we all feel better now.

My stomach feels utterly empty, ready to crumble up into a ball in my stomach, squeezing me from my middle. I'm so empty of energy and care that I am basically still awake through some kind of weird momentum. I shouldn't be awake at this moment. Goddammit. The amount of curse words I am using here suggests that I feel the need to shock and startle my readers, to repel them with my bitterness, to direct all force outwards. 

The air is cold at my back, and my headphones are starting to feel heavy on my head, dragging my ears down, and creating a dull ache in my head that makes it hard to think about all that much. Why haven't I just finished the post by now? Well, I don't want to just post some piece of shit that doesn't actually contain anything worth reading, and I guess I am just in some kind of horrible infinite loop, where I keep typing until I feel better, but I don't feel better, and so I keep typing.

I hate ants. I hate them so much. 

I am freezing down to my very joints. My fingers are not even feeling the keys as I press them, and I think muscle memory is the only way I am still able to type anything. You know I didn't go to a concert tonight? Do you know why? Because I didn't want to go alone, and have to be observed by people I didn't know. I didn't want to feel the eyes on me like some kind of convict, as he is lead up the courtroom stairs. Was anyone going to be watching me? Well, probably a little, but it doesn't goddam matter because I have nothing to hide, nothing to worry about anyone seeing. Right, they aren't seeing my thoughts, they aren't seeing my personality. So what I am so worried about. I guess that they will say in their heads "That is a weird guy over there. What's wrong with him?" Where are his friends? My hands are starting to numb, and the joints are losing their flexibility. I feel like I am getting old with shocking speed, and that by the time I actually fall asleep I'll be an old man, eyelids drooping over cloudy eyes, skin paper-thin, translucent and shockingly soft to the touch.

Frank Zappa can make me feel better. He says "Go Cry On Somebody Else's Shoulder". He knows what he's talking about. I sure as hell don't. How much wisdom do you think there is in the world? Do you think you'll ever be as wise as you need to be. Wow, we are doomed to keep screwing up, to keep hitting fly balls until after your arms are like dead weight, dragging you down, you hit one final pitch, and feel the shock tear through you, and the ball cracks out above you and you know its going nowhere fast, and you look up and pull your helmet off, and look into the sun, and put your hand up to your forehead, to hold back the glare, and you can't keep your balance, and your legs crumple under you, and you fall back into the hard-pack dirt, and you close your eyes on the ground, and the next thing you know, its late at night, and the crickets are chirping. You are suddenly terribly cold, and you can't remember what happened. 

That's the story. Looking into the sun is a good metaphor. Words escape me. Beats shake me. What the fuck am I doing? Certainty. 

Steinski. Beautiful, Beautiful. 

Tribal melodies. Muffled drums. Silver Apples. Captain Nemo, cresting up out from underwater, water pouring off the top everywhere, heavier than you could have believed, like he's really splitting the sea apart, standing there, gazing at you calmly, as more and more dull grey metal emerges from the dark dark green water, slimy, like some kind eel. The drums come back. They seem to be at your back. 

A Tambourine, and a buzz, and suddenly it is all over. 

That is the end of this weird episode.

  <title>An New Addition to the List of Common Terms</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I am in the process of pyschoanalyzing myself. This is turning out to be very difficult, and the times when I actually achieve an insight are few and far between. 

The problem is, I am trying to answer the question, "How am I thinking and feeling?", and that's close enough to a fish trying to learn about water to make me wonder if it's worth the effort to keep trying to get the bottom of things. 


But so far I've kept it up, mostly because I want more than anything else to get myself in order, get myself facing forward, standing tall on my feet, eyes gazing in front of me. And whenever I get frustrated I wonder if maybe I'm trying too hard, if maybe all I need is to give up trying to change anything, and resign myself to my fate, whatever that may be. 

But I don't know if I can do that, and I don't want to not want to be different. I don't want to be happy with myself as I am. I want to want to be better. I want to always be the most I can be. I don't want to let any potential go unfulfilled.

I forget who it was that said that he didn't want to arrive at the end of life in good condition. He wanted to end up battered and bruised, and taken for a ride, cause if he only gets one chance, why not make the most of it. 

This makes sense, I guess, but I know that I can't do this, the way I want to. The way I want to.

Anyway, here's a concept that I think I am adding to my list of concepts that I will use to understand my life: RAM, an apt term for me at this time, as I delve deeper and deeper into the field of computer science, finding myself in waters of increasing darkness, far from the surface, and without a path to guide me. The idea came to me, as I decided to shut all of the 50 or so Firefox tabs that had been accumulating over the past couple weeks. I had been reluctant to close them for the longest time, as they all were things I wanted to read, or look into further. But today, after a day spent wasting time, feeling like shit, and desperate to get out of this malaise, I just got rid of all of them. I realized that I was feeling so bad in part, because of all the stuff that I was trying to keep in my mind, all of the thoughts that I wasnt pausing before completion, because I wanted to do other things first. I just need to decrease the amount of stuff I am thinking about, becuase I was using so much of my attention just trying to manage the things that I wanted to focus on, that I couldn't really focus on any one thing. I need to work on this. 

Like I had a whole bunch of goals I had assigned myself in the social sphere that I had been holding off on, because I had been telling myself that I needed to reflect more on them, and that I had other higher priorities for the present. 

Last night's post was one of my worst ever, and I think the reason for that is that I was literally so full of shit to think about that I couldn't go anywhere. So I'm throwing shit out now, getting my head all clear and focused. I am paring down, cutting off the fat, tapering my light from a wide cone to a single bright point. Like a laser, I will burn a hole through a wall, I will bore down into the earth. 

But this means that I will actually want to right now go get some things resolved. So I'm going to post this now, and when I have finished with the other stuff come back to post here again, done for the night.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I was struck recently by the fact that computers are at their heart, nothing more than a whole bunch of rapidly flipping switches. You think about them like absurdly stupid little switches but into a box, and pumped full of electricity, and you suddenly are surprised that they can do anything at all. 

At the bottom of it all, you have nothing to work with but stupid little on-and-offs. That's all. And you have to figure out how to make those little bits represent text, windows, 3d worlds, numbers, people, places, colors, motion, ideas. No wonder trying to do anything on a computer sometimes seems like trying to build a fully-functional car out of the contents of your fridge on an average day. The fact that we are able to represent some concepts, like lists, and functions, and stuff like that seems like a miracle, given the brain-dead materials we are working with. 

What should a programming language be like ideally? Well, the only thing I can say with any certainty is that it should strive to eliminate incidental complexity, so that the programmer doesn't have to think about anything other than the problem they are trying to solve. Does any language do that now? No, though maybe Haskell gets close sometimes, and Scala is very concerned about that, though in an entirely different way. I'm sure that there are others I would be impressed by, but those are the two that come to mind right now. 

How did we decide that Windowing systems were a good idea? Why do we use a mouse, and keyboard, two devices which are utterly incapable of providing feedback directly? Why is the desktop the primary metaphor for consumer computing? Because I think it is incredibly misleading, and it serves to distract from the real beating heart of computing, which is coding. I recognize the audacity of that statement, and I don't intend to justify it fully, but I think that the whole computational perspective that is afforded by learning to program is invaluable, and that without it, you are ill-equipped to make the most of your world. The number of opportunities for understanding and doing that you are foregoing if you can't program is beyond comprehension to me. 

Listen to: <em>Shoot Out the Lights</em> by Richard and Linda Thompson. It is wonderful. My favorites are "Don't Renege On Our Love", "Man in Need", "Just the Motion", and "Shoot Out the Lights". Listen to <em>Sea Change</em> by Beck. It will not do anything for you at first, but give it a chance, and it will become incredibly affecting. 

Whatever, I'm tired now, and I'm going to sleep soon, and I'm done for now.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[When I started that last post, I has something I wanted to say, but by the time I started writing I had forgotten it, and I just remembered it again. 

I used to read all sorts of tracts by Atheists and Scientist-types that attempted to make it exceedingly clear why religion was factually incorrect, not to mention the cause of all sorts of evils, the opiate of the masses, the delusions of those unable to face reality, the insipid imaginings of those whose can't just do with marveling at the cosmos.

Anyway, one question would often come up, which I found to be the biggest waste of time. Basically, some clergyperson, when confronted with evolution or something else that to them implied that God didn't exist would invariably ask the scientist-type, "What then separates Human Beings from mere animals?" To me that question seemed hopelessly ill-formed, since it seemed beyond obvious that while biologically, the differences between us and them were just quantatative, they led to the emergence of behavior and thoughts that were qualitatively very different. The clergy would argue that without the grace of God, there was nothing to elevate us above the beasts, to which I thought, "Why does there need to be something separating us?" and "It's obvious we are different. I'm talking and my dog isn't. The evidence says we are different, and the only question is how to explain that difference, but it's not like we are forced to resort to barbarism unless we are certain that God made us."

But then the atheist person would counter by explaining that we are biologically more complex, that we have a brain and all sorts of advanced functionality, which seemed to me to be missing the point. Why should they concede that the scientific understanding of the world is incapable of matching the church for explanatory power unless it can account for some perceived difference? Nothing falls apart if you admit that we are just animals, maybe better groomed, and clothed, but animals underneath it all. 

But despite my dismissal of that whole stupid issue, one thing that stuck with me was the idea of "grace". 

I don't know what Grace is, but I know more and more that Grace is something worth fighting for, that Grace is what makes life living. My definition is vague and amorphous, but I have no doubt that Grace is one of values that transcends all petty concerns, that can transform mundane existence into something magical, something worth all the effort, all the fuss. 

And that's what I wanted to say. Also, listen to <em>Sail Away</em> by Randy Newman, it will make you feel good. 

Good Night

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Every programmer I've known has had a strong opinion on which programming language they preferred to use, and (being macho and arrogant) has believed that their language of choice is objectively better. 

This may not be surprising to non-programmers, but what may be more surprising is the content of the arguments about languages. Very often, languages are compared in very impressionistic ways, and a lot of complaints about languages are about how they feel clunky, or are ugly. 

When I talk about a language being clunky or ugly, what I think I'm really talking about is the amount of distance the language puts between my ideas and their implementation. ]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Deeper into Music</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So I've been getting deeper into music.

I've been rapidly absorbing new genres and artists, and I think I've reached a new stage in my music appreciation adventure. I've begun to notice more stuff in the music I do listen to, and I now am able to pay attention to songwriting in a way that I hadn't before.

I don't have the ear yet to describe what I am picking up on in music theoretical terms, but I am noticing certain patterns, certain shapes that characterize certain artists. Paul Simon has a songwriting style that I think is very distinctive, for example. His best songs all are very gentle-feeling, with these winding vocal melodies that never feature dramatic shifts in emotion. I've been listening to <em>There Goes Rhymin' Simon</em> which is a masterpiece of an album. Pretty much every song is a gem, a carefully constructed, carefully orchestrated story. It's hard to think of a single song that doesn't hold up all that well, and the only one that comes to mind is "Was a Sunny Day", and I think it's good, just not maybe as good as the rest. 

I'll say more later, but I'm tired, and hopefully this post will get me back into blogging. So I'm gonna call it quits for the night.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I find myself here again, and I guess that is a good thing.

I don't find myself compelled to blog anymore, simply for the sake of persisting in something, but I also can't think of all that much content that I want to publish. Though I think what has happened is that I have unconsciously limited the range of content that I feel would be right to publish, and as a result I have let all sorts of things go unpublished because they didn't fit my image of what the content of my blog should be. So now I am here, and I am going to write whatever I feel like, pretending that there are no readers (not that much of a stretch of the imagination). Here we go:

I read somewhere that when kids come back from college for the summer or other holiday periods, they often regress to behaviors that they had before college. All the maturity they gained in college seems to have no impact when they get back home, and they find themselves feeling like stupid children again. I think that is happening to me now. I am not acting as I know I can be.

I wanted to start a series of posts on great albums on the blog. But then I figured out that I don't know how to have a listing of those posts be systematically generated and kept in alphabetical order, so that all I have to do is tag the post appropriately and it would show up. And I don't really want to have to manually put this all together. I am considering a switch from the wordpress.com site to a wordpress.org self-hosted site so that I do all sorts of programming of the blog myself. A lot of ideas I have for the blog are simply too annoying to implement within the constraints of this site for me to put the effort in. Also, I keep wanting to find small programming projects, and I suspect this could be a good one. 

Actually I am now thinking that I could create a cool little command line program to keep track of my favorite albums for me, which would be a good learning experience in many ways, and would probably be something I would actually use if I did it right.

Oh yeah, emotional, revelatory stuff. I am not sure about any of that. 

I love Paul Simon, and I might put him in my top 10 artists of all time right now.

I don't know what I think about the Hold Steady. Sometimes, they are just right, but other times, I feel that they are kind of juvenile. 

I keep finding that some artists are mysteriously missing on Amazon or iTunes, which are the two largest MP3 stores on the internet. 

Notable ones so far: Gang of Four (lots of missing albums), Frank Zappa (lots of missing stuff), The Kinks (the worst of the three, tons missing).

I don't know what the deal is with those artists, but I do know that I would have listened to a lot more of their stuff were they to be available at these sources. It's such a hassle to get them physically.


I get annoyed by things too easily sometimes. I fail to look on the bright side of life sometimes. I want to look on the bright side more often. I hope that I can remind myself to do so. ]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So I haven’t been blogging in quite some time. But I think I’m back now for good, back for the long haul. What changed? I think I’ve untangled my life to the point that I can direct my attention to things other than just trying to stay above water. That sounds kind of melodramatic, but I don’t really want to go into details, and I’m stuck with these cliches for the time being. I have decided to make a mental shift of weight towards the blog, and so I am confident that this return to the blog is not just another empty promise. I say this as though I had legions of fans who I’ve let down. I don’t.

I only realized just how long I’d been letting this blog go without my full attention when I saw that the left sidebar described me as a Freshman, and listed my current records in rotation incorrectly. That’s been fixed. 

Since I am now officially a sophomore on the blog, I thought I’d take a few moments to reflect on the things I’ve learned after my first year of college. 

I’ve learned more this year than I could have imagined, and I think I’ve matured tremendously, so much so that I have trouble relating to the scared kid that flew out to Providence in September. If I were able to talk to that kid now, I think I would try to tell him that everything is going to be alright. I’d tell him that he’s gonna feel really down sometimes, feel like there is nobody out there who can understand him, feel like he’s so far behind that there’s no hope of catching up.

I’d tell him not to be so afraid. I’d tell him that everyone is just as scared as he is. I’d tell him that he needn’t pretend to be anything he’s not, that people would like him as he was, and that he was good enough. 

I had a really rough first year, I think because I began the year with a whole mess of misconceptions and personal issues that I had to confront and correct before I could get on to the work of attending college, living and learning.

I used to have a really bad self-image. I thought of myself as some kind of secret genius, a brilliant mind neglected by the world, like a Matt Damon in <em>Good Will Hunting</em>. I resented the world for having mistreated me, for having failed to recognize my talents. I had a burning urge to prove them wrong, to show the world how it was wrong in dismissing me. I believed I was smarter than everyone I knew. I wasn’t interested in learning from other people because I didn’t believe they had anything they could teach me. This sounds absurd now, and I’m oversimplifying for the sake of storytelling, but this isn’t too far from the truth. I didn’t see the value of friendship, of anything other than the intellect. 

At the same time, I also was incredibly critical of myself, and I always believed I could be doing better. I wasn’t happy with anything about myself, and I thought I was a bad person, a stain upon the world. I was socially inexperienced, and I thought of myself as hopelessly awkward, an outcast from society, incapable of relating to other people, or of being loved. I didn’t need other people. I knew that I wasn’t worth loving, and knew that no one would like me if they got to know me. I wasn’t likable. I accepted that as a fact, and assumed that people didn’t want to know me, didn’t want to spend time with me.

So I lived between two extremes, chaotically alternating between haughty arrogance and utter despondency and self-hate, all the time on edge, and wrapped in my own head. And I alternated as well in my attitudes towards everyone I met. One moment, I would think of them as useless, stupid philistines, not worth talking to, and certainly not worth listening to. The next moment, I would be suddenly struck by a sense of inadequacy. They all deserved to be here, and I knew I surely didn’t. I felt like I was a fraud, and could feel their gazes on me, seeing right through my facade to the loser at the core. Wherever I was, I could sense them watching me, judging me, giving off vibes that said to me “You don’t belong here. You aren’t one of us.” I felt like an intruder on campus.

When I put together the entire mindset I had coming in to Freshman year, and for much of the year, it is obvious that I had major issues in need of resolution, but at the time, I didn’t realize that there were alternatives to any of these assumptions. To my mind, all of the aforementioned beliefs and attitudes reflected facts about the world. The brute fact of the world led me to these beliefs, and the beliefs were just acknowledgements of what I knew to be fact. 

It’s always really hard to see what your assumptions are, and only know is it clear just how much I was assuming. I still haven’t gotten to the lessons I’ve learned, but I think that with this background in place, I can finally get to those. 

Lesson 1: You should treat every interaction with other people as an opportunity to learn, and not as challenge. The more people you talk to, the more opportunities you have to make friends, to build relationships that will matter to you. Don’t worry about being judged at all. People are fundamentally good, and they recognize that we are all fallible.

Lesson 2: You deserve to be here as much as anyone else, and you have as much of a right as anyone else to use the resources available. You needn’t feel like an intruder in the hall of your dorm. You are just as important as anyone else here. 

Lesson 3: Do as many things that scare you as possible. You are in this wonderful, protected environment, and this is the perfect opportunity to find out what you like and don’t like. Explore everything. Make the most of your time. 

Lesson 4: The most valuable thing here is the people. You are going to meet all sorts of wonderful people, and you should put time and energy into your relationships, into getting to know these people. Be honest with the people you meet, and don’t be afraid of them, and listen to them. 

This piece is meandering a fair amount, I realize, and I’m repeating myself in places. I just can’t make it clear enough how important it is to approach the experience in the right way. Part of the reason I am so emphatic is that I am still trying to internalize these lessons, and the more time I spend just trying to put this into words, the better I get at understanding exactly what it is I now believe. 

I’ve changed faster than I’ve been able to keep track of, and so I currently am trying to figure out where I am. 

I think this is enough for now.

Be back soon, 
your sleepy Author.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>The World's a mess; It's in my kiss</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[	I am in Rome. The night is getting there. I love how as it gets later and later, all sounds seem to retreat as your room expands. By now, this room could be the only room in the entire universe (a reference to “F.E.E.L.I.N.G. C.A.L.L.E.D. L.O.V.E.” by Pulp off <em>Different Class</em>). Sound just doesn’t fill up a space the way it does at the sane hours of the day. 

	You know how sometimes when you are really tired, so exhausted that your body will accept whatever unfortunate position you leave it in. Your arm dangles loosely on the wooden seat of a bench, and you realize that you can’t actually feel your hand after a minute. You know it is there, and you aren’t in pain or anything, you just have no idea without looking in what position it has come to rest, and you can’t remember what it would feel like to move your hand. And of course you pick your hand up after a moment, and it’s perfectly normal. But there is this moment, where your soul has slipped out of your body a tiny bit. I imagine that an astute observer would see a single image of me, and then suddenly I would suddenly split into two, one a little bit offset, faint and shifting like in an optometrist’s office, when two ‘E’s swirl around each other, and you are asked to note the moment that they line up. 

After being in a city like Rome, or Syracuse, or Naples, where the air is heavy with history, it’s hard not to be awed by the unbroken chain of human experience that connects you with the past, the countless days and hours and years of sweat and toil that can be glimpsed now in the structures left behind. It really freaks me out, because if a city like Rome can be reduced to ruins from such a glorious peak, I suddenly become a lot less sure what the world will look like even 100 years from now. Rome at its ancient peak had well over a million inhabitants. That’s comparable to many of current cities, and on the same order of magnitude as even the biggest cities today. I tend to assume that the ancient world was in some sense much smaller than the modern world, so that the fact that Rome is in ruins means nothing for today’s world, since a city of that size or density or economy cannot sustain its momentum forever, whereas it is different today. But I’m not so sure anymore. I can’t imagine Manhattan 2000 years from now being just ruins, but I know that the Romans couldn’t have imagined what their home would look like now, and so maybe the modern world is less permanent than I assume.

Tiny little free association:

cat rat hat bat bomb Dom, relational mapping, hierarchy, beds, sweat, deep carpets, heavy curtains, singing ’til your throat is dry, shoot out the lights, Guitar strings vibrating with visceral weight. Night writer. Hacking in green on a black screen. A terminal. Pipelines. The weight of expectations. Zen. Baldness. For what was once will once again be. Poseidon, Neptune, and the outer ring of our solar system. The wedding ring, on a black and cold finger. Frostbitten love. Nose bright red. The weird way it feels to put your hands on your own numb body, to feel something missing, to realize that you are made of meat. Not chips. (Made of meat). Irish folk, Brothels, Pompeii, cheesy barmitzvah dances, slides, water slides, water snakes, eels, eyes like marbles, polished black pearls. The Pearl. That California valley. The wine, and the fields, and the smell as you drive down south back home. Back to the little corner of the world (Yo La Tengo) where the air is familiar, and the world feels more solid and fixed than anywhere else. Goodnight.

(Goodnight.) Good Luck.
-Switzerland Sweden, Swindler, Spencer

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I am dead tired, just exhausted to the bone. I don't think I can think right now, and I'm only awake because my laundry is in the dryer. There is nothing else keeping me awake. How I wish I was asleep. This happens all the time, and I feel really stupid for not having been able to foresee this. Ugggghhhhhh. I can't even think of a song to mention, cause I can only pay attention to songs now if I have been listening to them a lot recently. I'm just so tired. I keep seeing myself just falling out of my chair and slumping onto my bed, teeth unbrushed, in my shoes and everything, with music still playing. What am I playing now? Fiona Apple. 

Ugggghhhhhhh, 
Goodnight.

Jet lag is a bitch. I don't know why, but this is the worst it has hit me in a long time.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[The above quote is from "People" by The Silver Jews, off <i>American Water</i>. 

I really don't have anything to say right now. 

I feel like I have the potential to accomplish tremendous things. But I must decide in which realm I want to accomplish so I can get started. That is quite the dilemma. 

I should probably just go to sleep.

Part of the reason that I haven't been blogging so much recently, is that I haven't really felt like I've had anything I wanted to say particularly. 

Whenever I have free time, I would much rather program or play guitar, or spend time with people than blog. Ugghhhh. 

I don't know. Maybe I'll regain my enthusiasm some time soon, but I don't know. I'm tired, man.

Goodnight.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Here's something: 

I hate that it isn't okay acknowledge that any social interaction has more going on than may be immediately apparent. Whenever I spend time with someone, I am choosing to do so, because I enjoy spending time with that person. If I eat a meal with someone, I am choosing to spend time with that person. I can always eat alone. With a backpack and a laptop and headphones, I am theoretically able to never spend any time with anyone. In that context, any social interaction is a reciprocal agreement to spend time with each other with the implicit understanding that the parties in question enjoy the company of the others. 

But you can't say that. It is unacceptable to talk about wanting to spend time with people without concrete activities in mind. I hate the conventions of conversation that say that social situations can never be explicitly addressed. 

------

ten minutes later:

I wrote the above, and saved it as a draft, hesitant to publish it, because I wasn't totally comfortable with it.

But that reminded me that I can post whatever the fuck I want to the blog, and so it's going up. (How do I always manage to lose sight of this one foundational fact?)]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I don't understand sometimes anything at all.

I feel like I can't ever get anywhere, that I am spinning in circles, falling down stairs, knocking over pitchers, crushing glasses, stumbling into walls.

I don't particularly want to share the circumstances which lead me to this sorry state. So there isn't much to talk about.

Inspirational song: Mandinka, by Sinead O'Connor (have no idea what the lyrics are about, but it is inspirational musically.)

Power chords are cheap shots. Pre-chorus is cheating. Rhyming is cheating. Stealing is cheating. 

What is up with Sinead O'Connor these days?

Does she know Haskell? or Lua? Why not? How not? 

Where is Ornette Coleman now?

Who watches the watchmen?

Topic: Compare and contrast Alan Moore and RMS (Richard Matthew Stallman). They both are visionaries in their respective fields, both extraordinarily eccentric, and considered part of the fringe. They both have beards that bring to mind Moses on the Mount, or a crazy hippie, or a homeless person. 

Topic: In what way do the things that we think about affect the things we think about? (By we, I mean us.)

See how when I am in a bad mood, I resort to bitter wordplay, and showoffy flights of fancy, burying whatever serious sentiment I'm holding under ironic distance and detachment so that I am a cipher, a labyrinth, a Rubik's Cube, a Chinese finger trap, an enigma, a paradoxical little pill, a pen fresh out of ink, a curved semi-solid self-lit ocean.

No, I feel bad. How bad you ask? Pretty bad, not that bad. Why? Reasons. When? The Book Depository. How? A candlestick and a lead pipe. Whodunit? The C.I.A. and the F.B.I. together in retaliation for their embarrassment in that whole Bay of Pigs thing. Because I am providing no context whatsoever for this stream of consciousness, I am worried that it will be misinterpreted as something more meaningful than the idle play of a frustrated fool, and I will spend hours, nay, day, nay, weeks, explaining myself to people to whom should know better. Fuck it. Let's do it live. I'm gonna publish.  ]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[All of the content of this mini-post is in the title above. 

So now I will fill some space with filler. Filler. Filler. Thriller. Killer. Biller. Miller. 

Little Johnny Jewel. Torn Curtain. Tom Verlaine. Buckminster Fuller.

Ironic Observation: The stream of consciousness I am employing here in an attempt to irritate and alienate my few remaining readers is exactly the thing to do if I want to get better search engine placement. If I want to push people away as much as possible, it seems the only thing to do is just to not blog at all. Which is stupid. Because then I'm not being proactive about alienating people, and that's the fun part. 

So, note to self (and entire world, since it is totally available for all interested parties to view): NO FREE ASSOCIATION. CHAIN YOUR ASSOCIATION UP LIKE A PRISONER, AND FEED IT FOOD THAT BARELY AVOIDS BEING CRUEL AND UNUSUAL. Imprison it. 

But of course, I am not going to actually chain up my association, so I suppose I will just have to accept the traffic, and try to look on the bright side. Oh, First World Problems, how you make a fool of me!

Oh, Sun, Oh Moon, Oh no, Yoko Ono, Ok Go, Okay, Kay, ay, Dancing on my Own is a fantastic song, very inspirational. Which is not necessarily related to the quality of a song, but which is always a plus in my mind. I use too many words to say too few things.

I only blog when upset these days. Problem? Yes. Solution? Nothing comes to mind. Solvent? Water. It's universal. Universal Studios. Jurassic Park. Roger Williams Park. Park of Ages. Rock of Parks. Aquarius. Aquarium. Feed the Fishes. Unnecessary Capitalization, Capitalisation. Britishism. Britticism, like Witticism but more English. Kilt. Like quilt, but different at the beginning. Grammar, BNF, FSA, HFS+. The sheer number of acronyms in Computer Science is a lot. I know a lot now, and I don't really have any idea to do with all of them, besides be reminded of my life as a programmer every time I see three capital letters in a row. Bottled up in Cork. -&gt; Listen to the song that is pointing at this sentence. Why? I like it quite a bit. My taste es su taste. Mi taste esta dormiendo, bebido, refresco, the great taste of Diet Coke (tm) (mt) (mm) (tt). LET"S PERMUTE: toys, yots, syot, that's all I could come up with. 

Ooops, I just free associated. Darn.

Goodnight, Moon.

  <title>Mesmerizing to you, too...</title>
  <link>http://starlingsoftheslipstream.wordpress.com/2011/08/03/mesmerizing-to-you-too/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So the reason that I haven't been blogging much of late is that I have very rarely been in this mood, the blogging mood, and I'd totally forgotten about the mood until right now, when it suddenly struck, and I just had to post.

Right now, I am listening to Liz Phair's <i>Exile in Guyville</i> which is one of those rare albums that never gets old, that I can put on after not hearing it for a year, and it will feel like home, like the best of friends, like pulling into your driveway on the way home from the airport after a long vacation. 

Right now, I love this album more than words. I mean that literally. I am trying to express how much I love this album, but I'm sure that no matter what I write, it won't convey the way the album just seems so infinitely satisfying, so right. Maybe this will help: It's like a river flowing in a desert canyon, along grooves eroded away over the centuries, and they seem to fit the river so well, so comfortably, and the current just moves in these wonderfully complex and convoluted tracks, always seeming to slip into the right channels, falling into place, rushing forward to meet its paths, to follow the course laid out for it.

I don't know if that was even the slightest bit helpful. 

If I weren't disillusioned by years of experience, I would tell you to immediately go out and listen to this album, so that you too could have this revelatory experience, so that you could take in these warm waves of sound, this invisible energy. But so rarely does it work that way, and I've grown to expect that you won't have that same experience. I can't how happy it would make me if I could just share this with other people. 

I just saw the new Captain America movie. Not bad. As I mentioned to my friends earlier, they (the movie people) have gotten really good at making a solid crowd-pleasing superhero movie. Throw in some humor, some romance, some over-the-top awesome action, some sly nods, and you've got a pretty solid movie. Keep it moving, don't take yourself too seriously. I feel like they could churn out these movies for years, just changing sets and casts, and they would keep having hits. And I don't mean this disparagingly. I mean, these movies aren't great works of art, works of forceful originality, and clear vision, but I'm entertained, and I get caught up in them. I come out of the theater excited, head racing with images, happy and energetic. 

I've been programming in Haskell in pretty much all of my waking hours, and I've gotten really into it. I've got a pretty good grasp of the basics, and I'm beginning to really really get into Monads, which are these mathematical objects that are really powerful, and really elegant, and which are really emphasized in Haskell, and which are considered a Haskell thing, despite their existence in some other languages. I've seen it now on a bunch of different sites, but it is a truism that every Haskell programmer will at a certain point in their learning of the language write a tutorial that talks about Monads, and tries to explain them in a different way than all the other tutorials do. I'm planning on doing my unique spin on the Monad tutorial in a bit, so get ready. 

Which reminds me of my How to Get Started Programming on Mac OS X tutorial series, which currently stops suddenly after Part 2. I'm gonna get back to that, so rest easy. 

Whoa, I am feeling really good, but I don't want to jinx it, by using all this energy and good-feeling for blogging, and so I think I'm done for now. Hopefully, I'll be back soon.

  <title>Dry The Rain?</title>
  <link>http://starlingsoftheslipstream.wordpress.com/2011/08/08/dry-the-rain/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Over the past month or two I've invested almost all of my free time in the exploration of different programming languages. I've spent the most time on Haskell by far, but I've looked into quite a few, and read quite a lot on the topic, and I feel like I am getting to the point of being able to have something slightly intelligent about the subject.

I've now programmed in Haskell, Python, Ruby, Java, C, C++, Racket/Scheme/Lisp, and I think I have a wide enough base of knowledge know that I can pick up a language and start making headway with it in a short period of time. If the documentation is good enough, There's little I can't figure out how to do.

I had the idea a while back that it was my destiny to create a programming language of my own. I don't mean destiny in a sword-and-prophecy, Greek-tragedy, story-telling kind of way, but rather as an organizing goal around which I could focus my efforts, a context in which I could look at the languages I was learning. I think it would be awesome to create my own language, to then let it loose into the world to have whatever impact it would. I've not given myself any sort of timeline, and I don't have anything concrete planned at the moment, but I'm keeping that goal in mind, and I'll see what happens. So for the past month or so, whenever I saw something interesting, I could ask whether this was a feature I would want in my ideal language, whether I think it actually was beneficial to the programmer, making it easier to read, write, and maintain a program, or whether it was a distraction that would inevitably ending up doing more harm than good.

The features I've come to think very highly of are mostly those that allow the intentions of the programmer to be expressed more directly, which allow the programmer to think at whatever level of abstraction he or she chooses, without being constrained by the capacities of the language. So this means that I want higher-order functions, first-class functions, algebraic datatypes, pattern-matching, closures, lambdas, and typeclasses.

I don't really care about OO at all, and at the moment, I think that the world has spun too far in the direction of Object-Oriented programming, and that we have a long ways to go before there is even the possibility of it being underused. Continually I find that Object-Oriented programming translates into practice into continually trying to work around the restrictions imposed by the system, making it a constant battle to get the code to do what you want it to. Many of the features that are touted by proponents of OO programming are not limited to that paradigm, and show up in functional languages. Haskell's typeclasses are essentially the same as Java interfaces. Class hierarchies are similarly possible in Haskell, and using abstract datatypes (which are admittedly a little bit tricky in Haskell) you can also mimic the encapsulation and state-controlling features of OO. (Though at the moment, I am a big fan of monads, and I think that they can provide a pretty powerful mechanism for doing the kind of stuff that is traditionally thought of as archetypal problems for OO to deal with.

I was reading some interview from <i>Masterminds of Programming</i> in which the interviewee expressed the opinion that the idea that there is some holy grail of programming languages out there, a perfect language that will allow for perfect expression of all thoughts, is utterly wrong, and any time spent trying to come up with one is an utter waste of time.

In the interviewee's opinion, the ideal situation re: programming languages is for there to be a profusion of domain-specific languages (DSLs), small languages with simple syntax and vocabularies designed for working in a particular domain. This is not a new idea, and DSLs exist today in all sorts of different places, although they haven't really taken hold in computing that much. For example, Western Music Theory uses a language of scales and modes and melodies and rhythms that allows musicians to communicate their ideas in way that can be understood by others, and which is suited to the type of composition that they want to do. (As a side note, in the 20th century, when composers became dissatisfied with that language, they invented their own languages, most famous of which is Twelve-Tone Composition.)

While I initially was taken aback by that idea, I'm beginning to think that it makes a lot of sense. When I program anything, a lot of the work consists in building up a vocabulary of verbs and nouns that I can string together to make complex behavior. When I write a todo-list application, I define many of the following: "deadlines" "importances" "lists" "entries". I don't consciously think about what I'm doing as defining a DSL, but that seems like a pretty good description of the activity. I suspect that most programmers would recognize that kind of work in their own experience, and would find that the concept of a DSL captures their activity pretty well.

Haskell, which is the subject of most of my attention these days, is used in academia for a lot of research on DSLs, and I've seen it expressed many times that Haskell is particularly well-suited to creating a domain-specific language, and that that capacity is its most extraordinary feature. Do I agree? Maybe.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello, I am writing this and it is way way too late at night.

How did I get here?

Well, I was making my way towards sleep, when I decided to pick up the
compendium of the Walking Dead that I recently acquired, and read a chapter or
two.

Two and a half hours later, I feel like I've lived through so much, feel tired
emotionally as well as physically. I guess the Walking Dead is a good series,
though I'm not sure I'm glad I picked it up in the first place. It's
compulsively readable, and utterly devastating. I have this weakness for works
that are all about the idea that you are never safe, works that take good people
and put them through unimaginable pain, and just when you think that there is no
way it could possible get worse, all hell breaks loose.

I think that zombie stories, or any stories about the end of civilization as we
know it, have a shared thesis, which is that beneath the thin veneer of decency,
when put against up a wall, people will literally do anything to survive. I
don't know. I can't explain them in any other way. 

I guess I can see the appeal of works that make you ask yourself, what would you
do to survive? Having lived your whole life following rules, never having to
fight for your survival, it's hard not to how you would do if suddenly all of
that was gone and it was just you against the world.

I understand that, but what troubles me about these stories is that I really do
think that people are better than that. I don't think it is necessarily true
that we would lose our humanity in the face of this kind of hardship. I don't
know, but I want very much to believe that we are better than that, that we
wouldn't turn on ourselves. 

I don't have any good reason to think that we are better than that, and I can't
do anything to prove it, but I feel like the one thing that these visions of
humanity forget is Grace. I don't even know what I mean by that really. I guess
I would say Grace is that quality that allows people to transcend their
humanity, their physical being, their troubles, and do something selfless and
wonderful. I know that is less than clear, but I can't do anything better than
that. 

I believe in Grace. I'm listening to Gilberto Gil right now, his first album,
which is one of my all-time favorites, and it's just wondrous, joyful and
exuberant, like a celebration of humanity. A perfect album. I say this without
being able to understand any of the lyrics, and for all I know, if I did know
them, I would think differently, but somehow, I suspect that they would only add
to the music.

I'm actually thinking of learning Portuguese, in order to be able to understand
these lyrics. I'm a huge fan of Brazilian Music, and I love the way that
Portuguese sounds, the way it looks, somewhere between the smooth rhythms of
Spanish, and the discrete gestures of spoken English.

So I just looked at the time again, and it's later than it was, and I should
really see what sleep I can get. So that's it for now, 

Goodnight.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Just checking in. Saying I'm here, I'm a bear, a pear, rhyming Simon, speaking in fractured English, sprained ankles, and chained angles. Beatles song of the day: "I've Just Seen a Face". Anonymous shout-out to the friend who got me hooked on this one. Good work, anonymous friend. I sometimes wonder if I should be more paranoid about keeping myself anonymous, or whether I should do the opposite, and make this page a real home for me on the internet. Though I'm thinking of leaving Wordpress for self-hosting soon, with a little bit of Git, Node.js, Heroku. But I probably won't get around to it for forever, because I am one lazy sun. Sunflowers, stunguns, sturgeon, the Nobel Prize, the way the light shimmers in water, the way you tense up at night, as your body tells you with increasing urgency to get offline and just go to sleep already, you little fool. So that's that. Transmission concluded.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I’ve been crunching the numbers lately (by which I mean looking at the stats WordPress provides me so graciously to inspire in me a lust for hits, and comments and such). The numbers aren’t good. No use in beating around the bush. They are bad, like less than one hit on average per day. Given that there are more than one subscriber (though not many more than one), I am surprised by how very few hits I have managed to rack up in the last couple weeks. But again, I don’t publicize, or even link to it on Facebook, or link to other blogs, or comment on current events, or write posts that are pithy, and highly opinionated, so I guess I should expect to be relegated to this dusty corner of cyberspace, this ghost town in the shell.

But it was never about the money, the fame, the groupies, the cars and nightlife, the looking out on the ordinary people like so many ants, so easily crushed beneath your heel. No, it was never about that. It was about artistic integrity, and having an outlet in which to vent my multifarious frustrations. Because frustrated is like my middle name, I guess. I don’t know if I really stand by that statement.

Anyway, some thoughts: I just recognized a pattern today that I am going to label, perhaps unfortunately, as the “fact-pattern pattern”, and which is that thing they do in sardonic indie movies where the narrator spends sections of the movie narrating by way of listing a bunch of facts and then having the stuff going on in the scene stand out in hilarious counterpoint to his utterly dry and unaffected commentary. Examples: Stranger than Fiction, Hi-Fidelity, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, and countless others in the past couple decades. I call this pattern the “fact-pattern pattern” because I am beginning to find it clichéd and annoying, and by labeling it thus, I make you cognizant of it, and you start to wonder about it. Sorry, folks, nothing to see here. In all seriousness, I do think that it is a kind of lazy storytelling technique, and that is has been overused in recent years. But enough about that (because I can’t think of anything else to say on the topic).

In terms of music, which I am always listening to, here are some developments: A Tribe Called Quest is trending up, (aka I am liking them these days). Sinead O’Connor continues to be awesome, have you heard “I Want Your Hands on Me”? That is one of the most sensual, sensuous songs I know. Great song. Just got around to <em>Adventure</em> by Television, and unsurprisingly given how much <em>Marquee Moon</em> is a favorite of mine, it is awesome. I’m also into Galaxie 500 and Luna these days. Oh yeah, and Delaney and Bonnie, and James “Blood” Ulmer, which is leading to the Dave Holland Quartet, and Ornette Coleman.

What do I make of the fact that I seem to be on my way to serious jazz appreciation by way of the edges of Free Jazz? Nothing. Also, liking Nick Drake, Frank Black, and Elvis Presley.

Here’s something: So I keep programming, been making a maze generator -&gt; maze solver in Haskell, and I spent a couple hours today bashing my head into my desk, expressing existential despair, staring at a screen that seemed like an impenetrable wall of characters. And what was I trying to get accomplished? Nothing new, just trying to improve the algorithm I was using to partition up a grid with randomly generated walls in connected subregions. So I had to break the stuff I had working, and it sucked. But now it works, and I love Haskell again, and I feel like the sky is my limit, by which I really mean, I am proud of my accomplishment, and I am excited to actually get the maze part working. I offered recently to help out with the HTTP package in the Haskell Platform Distro, which is understaffed at the moment. It would be awesome if I could give back to the community which has been so very helpful so far. One of my favorite things about Haskell is definitely the community, which is leagues ahead of the communities I’ve seen around other languages. Because Haskell has such an academic base, the average Haskeller seems to be absurdly educated, and regular programmers quickly get up to speed on basic category theory and type theory. More so than any other language I’ve used, you can keep learning without limit, and still be hitting concepts that can help out with everyday programming.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I’m one of the moodiest people I know. Yeah, I said it. So I have this thing, where for months at a time I will have little snippets, strange phrases, that will be stuck in my head, and pop up whenever I am otherwise unoccupied. For a while, the lyrics to the Dismemberment Plan’s “Back and Forth” would accompany me on my way to and fro class, and I wouldn’t be out a minute without hearing “There’s a kind of music that reminds me of you…”. Then that got displaced, and my head was home to “I wonder if there is an epistemological sense in which…e which was really annoying, and definitely a step down from one of my favorite songs of all time. And now, I think, we are entering the era of “I don’t really believe in anything anymore”, which besides being appropriate in almost no contexts whatsoever as a conversation starter, also just kind of hits me like a truck, and makes me wonder what the fuck is going on, in the larger sense, which is the only sense I am ever interested in exploring, as any one of my friends would tell you. They get tired of it sometimes, and I guess, so do I.

Just switched from <em>The Low End Theory</em> to <em>The Specials</em>, another album that can be played over and over again, and about which I have nothing negative to say. But I don’t often have anything negative to say about music, or at least I keep it to myself. Which reminds me…

I was thinking a couple of days ago about how a lot of the music we hear on the radio, particularly on classic rock radio, is really really not appropriate for all ages. I think this revelation was prompted by my recent Stones phase, in which I’ve been rediscovering <em>Sticky Fingers</em>, along with the rest of their classic period albums. While I am a huge fan of the album, it’s lyrical content is really, really questionable, particularly on “Brown Sugar,” which I’d rather not even post on the blog. But you can point to a lot of their stuff and find stuff that deserves further consideration. “Stray Cat Blues” (on <em>Beggar’s Banquet</em>) is about sleeping with a 15 year-old groupie. I was reading some article recently that put the album into historical perspective. The 70’s were a really tough decade for the Stones (excepting their ever-growing fame and fortune). They were all stoned out of their minds, living a hedonistic and depraved lifestyle that would scare all but the most hardened souls. This was the era that began with the Altamont Free Concert in 1969, which is symbolically understood as marking the end of the summer of love, the turning point at which all the naivety and idealism of the hippie generation would come crashing down in flames. At that concert, the Hell’s Angels were doing security for Stones, and Mick Jagger was punched by a attending concertgoer shortly after stepping out of the helicopter he took to the event. Fights kept erupting, and and all hell broke loose. At the close of the concert, four people were dead, one homicide, and three accidental deaths. People looted everything, smashed car windows, and generally did their worst. Look it up. It’s famous.

Why am I up at 3:52 am Eastern Standard Time? Because I can’t sleep, and I’m gonna wait for sleep to approach me, instead of trying to hunt it down myself. I’m tired of that. It’s been raining in Providence a lot these days, which I was not expecting based on my L.A. Augusts.

Over the course of my musical learning, I’ve begun to get an appreciation for the complex way in which the music business and artists work together, and separately to create the finished products that we listen to. When you think about artists in the context of their relationship to the music industry, you begin to appreciate all sorts of stuff that you wouldn’t otherwise.

Godël’s Incompleteness Theorem, one of the cornerstones of modern mathematics, is often considered one of the most difficult and abstract results of contemporary mathematics, and irrelevant to the sorts of stuff that one does on a daily basis. And I pretty much agree. Which is why I was stunned to hit upon it in a computer science book on Lisp. But that is the magic of Lisp, which I think is one of the most important languages, or language paradigms, to get a really good hold on. Because it is so elegant and simple, because it doesn’t constrain you at all, it lets you cut to the heart of stuff really really quickly, and you can think about things that no other languages will allow you to. But I’m getting tired, and I want to wrap up for now, so I’m gonna continue this later. Good night.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I need to figure out some systematic way of naming my posts, 'cause right now I just pick something pretty randomly, and the title ends up providing no clues as to the content of the post, so that I can't ever go back and look for that post in which I talked about <em>x</em> or something like that.

Again, still migrating off wordpress, but I really really get annoyed by HTML and CSS, so it's gonna be a while before I have a design that I am at all happy with. I find that whenever I am trying to make a webpage, I start trying to align some junk correctly, and look up to find that 3 hours have gone by with nothing to show for them. Trying to make a simple multicolumn layout is an exercise in frustration, and I have a newfound respect and awe for the designers at sites like facebook, or netflix, who have to deal with this shit on a daily basis, and have to do far more complicated things with their sites. I feel like using CSS and HTML is like trying to paint when the only brushes you have are huge and strangely shaped. You are continually thwarted in expressing even the simplest ideas by the poor design of your tools.

Stuff like Haml, and Sass go a little bit of the way towards fixing the problem, but they don't integrate perfectly with existing tools, and they introduce just enough of a hiccup in your workflow so as to continually remind you that you are working with tools that attempt to translate from a reasonable language to the real thing, as opposed to working in the language that ends up in your resulting page directly.

I haven't gotten all metaphysical recently, and I don't think I will for quite some time. I don't really know what to do about that.

Moved into my dorm room for the year. I like it. It's cozy, and relatively spacious. Right now, it's kind of bare, and I have random stuff lying about that I have yet to unpack, but I think it will be pretty cool when I'm finished setting it up.

I'm going to make quite an effort to keep it tidy this year, as I want to be comfortable working in my room, and I need a certain level of order and harmony in the room for that to be the case.

Already I've noticed that I start getting anxious when I am on campus, in a way that I didn't over the summer. I'm going to pay attention this year, and really try to make sure that I can feel comfortable on campus at all times. I realize that I often ignore my own level of comfort, somehow having unconsciously come to believe that it is normal to be moderately to extremely anxious at all times. But not this year (if I can help it.) So I'm on guard for anything that I am in the slightest bit unhappy about. Hopefully if I am conscious of this disturbance in the delicate harmony of my life, I will be able to take whatever action is appropriate to remedy the situation, and if there isn't any action possible, I can try to accept the situation. It's the serenity prayer all over again, but as I've said before, I think that is about the best prayer of all time, my desert-island prayer, and the single thing I'd probably tell myself to think about, if I could only give myself one thing to keep in mind.

Irene is on her way. I don't think it will be too bad, but I've never really been in a serious hurricane. Having just moved, I have all the wordly possessions I care at all about in a single room, so I'm not worried about getting that bored if I'm stuck inside for the next couple days.

Emotional status: Tired, and excited. Can't wait for everyone to get back to campus, to meet so many interesting and wonderful people. I can't wait to get back to classes. I am a little nervous though, and determined to do right all the things I did wrong in my Freshman year. That's a lot of self-imposed pressure, but that's how I roll, and hopefully I can temper some of that pressure, with a recognition of the halting and sometimes frustrating nature of progress, of the inevitable setbacks, and the times when you can't imagine ever getting it right.

I read a blog post today which talked about how there are a vast class of activities in which rationality is far less useful for learning than simple trial and error. For example, small talk (not the programming language (though I am looking into learning that next)). I am particularly bad at small talk. I don't enjoy it, I don't know how to do it, and pretty much everything about it offends my sensibilities. But there are enough situations where it is a valuable skill for me to want to improve my abilities in that realm. My instinct is to think abstractly about possible things to say in various situations, or something like that, but I realize that it would be far more conducive to my learning to just try and make small talk over and over again, and to refine my technique that way than to try to develop a comprehensive theory of small talk, a model I can use to generate responses and counter-responses, and so on and so forth.

There you go, over 900 words. Happy now?

I'm gonna go to sleep, because it is 4:00 am here, and I woke up at 10 am, after having somewhere in the realm of 3 hours of sleep. I have quite a debt to repay. Ugghhhh.

Yeah, so I'm done.

  <title>Salt of the Earth</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Ok, so a while back I mentioned that I have, at least sometimes, started to think of computers as having no magic in them whatsoever, no intelligence, nothing beyond the comprehension of the average individual. Computers are, from this perspective, nothing more than a huge number of switches lined up in neat little rows and shrunk down to fit into a very small space. Everything you do on a computer can ultimately be reduced to a very complicated sequence of switches flipping, in a CPU, on a hard disk, in RAM. The way these different components interact is a little tricky, and I don't really know all that much about computer hardware or architecture, so I don't want to venture into that realm.

But I do know that computers are not magical in the slightest, by which I mean to say that every behavior can be explained in terms of smaller component behaviors. Every behavior has a direct physical representation, perhaps a very complicated one, but it all bottoms out with switches, always. This is the reductionist's greatest dream come true, and it is this total visibility that distinguishes computer science from pretty much every other branch of science.

What's cool about computer science is you don't ever have to take anything for granted. Literally everything can be understood by going one level deeper, one level closer to the stupid switches. Now, I'm not saying that you should in fact know everything going at every level, but the ability to navigate seamlessly between levels of abstraction is an incredibly valuable skill for any computer scientist, as inevitably, abstractions will leak all over the place (See http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html). When programming, all of the hardest bugs I've had to fix have been operating at different levels of abstraction than I am expecting, and only when I was able to question the assumption that the bug was on a particular level was I actually able to fix it.

Functional programming allows you to do this easily, since you can almost always break a program into a bunch of different functions in a hierarchy, and start at the top of the hierarchy, and keep examining different functions until you pinpoint the bug.

By dealing with only pure functions as opposed to methods that can change global state, you can be assured that if the input of a function is good and the output is bad, that function is responsible for the error you are seeing. This is as opposed to imperative languages, where you are dealing with complicated states, and many different functions can alter some object's state. In that paradigm, it's hard to pin down where exactly something has gone wrong, as control flow, and state modification have essentially no restrictions.

Anyway, back to the idea that a computer can be understood all the way to the switches (by the way, I talk about switches instead of bits, because I think the electronic nature of bits makes them seem like something magical, which obscures their essential simplicity): A great many computer science concepts which seem arbitrary and kind of beyond comprehension at first, turn out to be very easily understood when you start programming. As you keep programming, you will inevitably have these moments where you will find yourself doing something tedious or repetitive, and you will think that you need a better system for getting stuff done. I know this is vague, but bear with me.

Example: I start programming for fun. I write some small toy programs, and then decide to write something that is going to be on a larger scale, and I know that I have to be organized about it to make anything halfway-decent. So I start making an overview document, in which I plan to log all changes, and I decide that I will always copy a file into a separate directory before I make any changes, so that I can make sure that I have the original file around, if any of my changes break the program, or if I want to see what changes I've made since the last stable version.

Well, I keep doing this, and eventually I end up with something that looks a lot like a version control system. It turns out that other people have run into the same trouble trying to keep a large project organized, and that they have built these systems to solve those problems. Git, Mercurial, Subversion, all of these are the result of people hitting this wall, and just trying to think about how they would solve the problem in a logical and automatic way.

It turns out that you can understand version control pretty intuitively by just thinking through what you would do when you ran up against this problem. There is no magic. In computer science, if you just ask yourself what you would do in a particular situation (and take enough stuff into consideration), you will end up hitting upon something like the solutions that exist now.

Another example: I always found interpreters to be beyond my grasp until recently. I just started thinking about how I would write an interpreter, and I came up with some ideas: I needed to have some way of parsing strings to expressions, and storing a table of defined symbols, and evaluating strings to literals. And here's the great part. When you actually start to look at how interpreters are made, they have all of the above types of functionality, and they're not so far off from what you would naturally expect.

A certain amount of experience is necessary to be able to keep in mind all the salient considerations for any particular piece of software, but I have found that once you have that, you can understand pretty much everything by just thinking of how you would go about writing the same software.

This is a long post, and I've got other stuff to do, so I will have to end it here.

  <title>Ok, Legions of Adoring Fans, I Am Back, Stop Making Me Feel So Guilty</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Yo,

This is me. You know, Spencer. Your gregarious host for this enchanted evening. Nick Drake is playing on my puny laptop speakers, though I'm really thinking about Pere Ubu. Look them up, please, 'cause they are awesome, awesome. Yeah, anyway, I'm back.

I tried to quit, but the fans just kept clamoring out for more, and I can't resist basking in the radiance of their love, a pure and unadulterated love much like that of someone who really loves someone else who they are in love with.

But, because I have been on such a long hiatus, I'm afraid to report that I mostly have music-related stuff to talk about, mostly just bands that I haven't had the chance to advocate for in the past couple of months, who I think need to be more widely known. But I will save that for the next post:

Here's something. I started writing a poem of sorts then got sidetracked and ended up with some inspirational quotes and a whole bunch of other junk. I don't know if I'll do anything with it, but here is what I have so far:
<blockquote>James Iry said that Philip Wadler said "a monad is a monoid in the category of endofunctors, what's the problem?"
Morrissey said "I am the son, I am the heir / to a shyness that is criminally vulgar / I am the son and heir of nothing in particular"
Elivs Costello said "I'm the town cryer, and everybody knows, I'm a little down with a lifetime to go."
W. B. Yeats said "The falcon cannot hear the falconer [..] The centre cannot hold"
David Thomas said "I've got these arms and legs that flip-flop, flip-flop"
Tanya Donelly said "Are there heartstrings connected / to the wings you got slapped on your back"
Alan Perlis said all sorts of crazy shit, and then he died.
Alonzo Church didn't say much that I can remember
I can't remember what was said when I was still a kid
Baruch de Spinoza said "I have striven not to laugh at human actions, not to weep at them, nor to hate them, but to understand them"
Pete Doherty said "I get along"
P = NP and it's a Howling Wind indeed
Kant said a lot of interesting stuff in awful, unreadable German
Wittgenstein said "Philosophy is not a theory but an activity" and that "The real discovery of philosophy is the one which enables me to stop doing philosophy when I want to. The one that brings philosophy peace, so thtat it is no longer tormented by questions which bring itself into question" and that "There are remarks that sow and remarks the reap"
William James said "Everybody should do things each day that he hates to do, just for practice" and "If any organism fails to fulfill its potentialities, it becomes sick" and "If you want a quality, act as if you already had it" and "The greatest weapon against strees is our ability to choose one thought over another" and "There is no more miserable human being than one in whom nothing is habitual but indecision" and "To change one's life: Start immediately. Do it flamboyantly"
David Foster Wallace said "I often think I can see in myself and in other young writers, teh desperate desire to please coupled with a kind of hostility to the reader"
John Searle "Where questions of style and exposition are concerned I try to follow a simple maxim: if you can't say it clearly you don't understand it yourself"
Feynman said "We can't define anything precisely"
Frege was agonizingly close to the truth, and even now you can't help but be in awe of his accomplishments</blockquote>
And that's that.

Goodnight Moon.

Goodnight Stars.

Goodnight.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey,

The blitzkrieg is over. An uneasy truce. You wouldn't believe the things that have happened, the wispy breeze of experience, the sudden blinding as you turn and are faced with the white hot reflection of the sun in the polished metal surface of a sedan.

Blitzkrieg Bop. They are generating steam heat. From a whisper to a scream.

Dub Housing. Navvy. Caligari's Mirror.

Yeah, that is me free-associating. Except for that last line, which is me trying to get you to check out Pere Ubu's <em>Dub Housing</em>, which is an utterly insane album that I am falling in love with.

News: My weekend mostly sucked, and I'm sleep deprived, and I am waiting on an email from a TA to tell me whether or not I have more work to do. If I do, I might just not do it, and go to sleep anyway. If I don't, then all the better.

I've been loving the music I've been listening to, and that's something.

I'm having trouble figuring out how much I want to share on this blog again, and I am going to err on the side of undersharing at the moment. Uggghhhh.

Anyway, my phone should be arriving in the mail tomorrow, and with any luck, my life can return to normal phone-wise. I cannot express in words the degree to which I hate my current phone. Whatever you are imagining me to mean, I promise you that you do not grasp the full depth of my hatred for this infernal device.

But that is not really the most exciting topic, so I'm going to stop talking about that.

Weather is good these days, though it is getting dark really early. I imagine it will continue to get darker earlier and earlier until the end of Daylight Savings Time on November 6th. I just googled that, 'cause I had no idea when the switch was. Whatever.

Last word this evening: Soporific]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey, this is gonna be a pretty short post, as I'm on my way to sleep soon, and I don't have all that much to say. I've finally made some real progress on getting my revamped site together, and I should be able to get it up and running within a couple of weeks. Or maybe even something more reasonable than that.

Whatever. Anyway, the title of the post comes from the song "Chivalry" by the Mekons on <em>Fear and Whiskey</em>, which is a fantastic album. Other good stuff I've been listening to recently: The Robert Cray Band's <em>Strong Persuader</em>, Girls' <em>Album</em>, Pere Ubu's <em>Dub Housing</em>, Sleater-Kinney's <em>Call the Doctor</em>, and Archers of Loaf's <em>Icky Mettle</em>. I cannot believe how much incredible music is out there, just waiting for someone to listen to it.

Oh, and Aztec Camera's <em>High Land, Hard Rain</em>, which I'm not sure about. I have to give it some more time before rendering my verdict.

Did you know Bertrand Russell invented Type Theory like 40 years before it was explored in the context of programming languages.

Now I'm going to sleep, so goodnight moon.

Goodnight, stars.

Goodnight, Mars.

Goodnight, folks.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I woke up early this morning, was out of bed at 7am. Tried to go to breakfast, realized the dining halls were all closed, returned to my room, and tried to figure out what to do for the next three and a half hours. I thought about doing homework, but I looked at the problem sets I had, and didn't feel like doing them at the time.

So I decided to work on my website project, and I started doing that. In accordance with my way of doing things, I'm getting way too hardcore about this site. My original goal was to get total control over the content of my website, and I thought I could somehow just generate a folder of static pages that I could upload somewhere, in order to actually deploy. And there probably is a way to do just that, but at some point in my research I rejected that approach for whatever reason, and my new approach is to control every aspect of the web hosting/development/deployment/whatever process, and it is turning out to be quite an involved and annoying process, and I'm having to get into all sorts of arcana that offends my self-image as a big-picture-kind-of-guy. But it's too late to stop now. Analogy: It's like I've opened Pandora's box, and now I have to catalog every goddamn one of the creatures that swarmed forth, and I have to know their whole fucking ecology, and I have to make sure I don't get bitten in the process.

To bring this back down to earth (as if the layers upon layers of software abstractions are any more concrete), I'm renting a machine running Ubuntu 10.04 in a datacenter in Newark, NJ. I've spent the last couple hours SSH'ing into that box (nicknamed spinoza), installing a whole bunch of random packages (emacs, git, apache, etc.), so that I can later run my server on it. I also bought some domain names, which I'll have to separately hook up to the IP of the server.

As for the site itself, I'm writing a ruby script to generate the site from a whole bunch of post files written in markdown, and some template files. I'm also using the <a title="twitter/bootstrap" href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">twitter/bootstrap</a> css/javascript/html toolkit, which makes everything really professional looking, but which I have to customize to get working in the way I would like. Isn't this exciting.

Change of topic: <em>The Velvet Underground and Nico</em> is really an incredible album, and I seem to have a new favorite track every time I listen. Recently, it's been "The Black Angel's Death Song", a spoken-word ramble surrounded by a swarm of eerie violin and tape hisses and clicks. In it, you can totally see the prototype for "Murder Mystery" on <em>The Velvet Underground</em> another of my favorite tracks.  The lyrics are utterly insane, and I love it:
<blockquote>"Candy screen wrappers of silkscreen fantastic, requiring memories, both lovely and guiltfree, lurid and lovely with twilight of ages, luscious and lovely and filthy with laghter, laconic giggles, ennui fort the passions, in order to justify most spurious desires, rectify moments, most serious and urgent, to hail upon the face of most odious time, requiring replies most facile and vacuous, with words nearly singed, with the heartbeat of passions, spew forth with the grace of a tart going under, subject of great concern, noble origin

Denigrate obtuse and active verbs pronouns, skewer the sieve of optical sewer, release the handle that holds all the gates up, puncture the eyeballls, that seep all the muck up, read all the books and he people worth reading and still see the muck on the sky of the ceiling

For screeching and yelling and various offenses, lower the queen and bend her over the tub, against the state, the country, the committe, hold her head under the water please for an hour, for groveling and spewing and various offenses, puncture the bloat with the wing of a sparrow, the inverse, the obverse, the converse,the reverse, the sharpening wing of the edge of a sparrow, for suitable reckonings too numerous to mention, as the queen is fat she is devoured by rats there is one way to skin a cat or poison a rat it is hetero four hear to three forthirightly stated.

To Rembrandt and Oswald, to peanuts and ketchup, sanctimonious sycophants stir in the bushes, up to the stand with your foot on the bible as king I must order and constantly arouse, if you swear to catch up and throw up and up up, a king full of virgin kiss me and spin it, excuse to willow and wander dark wonders divest me of robes-sutures Harry and pig meat, the fate of a nation, rests hard on your bosoms, the king on his throne, puts his hand down his robe, the torture of inverse and silk screen and Harry, and set the tongue squealing the reverse and inverse

Tantalize poets with visions of grandeur, their faces turn blue with the reek of the compost, as the livig try hard to retain what the dead lost, with double dead sickness from writing at what cost and business and business and reverse and reverse and set the brain reeling the inverse and perverse

Contempt, contempt and contempt for the boredom, I shall poison the city and sink it with fire, for Cordless and Harry and Apepig and Scissor, the messenger's wig seems fraught with desire, for blueberry picnics and pince-nez and magpies, the mseenger's skirt, would you plaese hook it higher, for children and adults all thos under ninety, how truly disgusting. Would you please put it down? a stray in this fray is no condom worth saving, as king I'm quite just, but it's just quite impossible, a robe and a robe and a robe and a bat, no double class inverse could make lying worth dying

With cheap simian melodies, hillbilly outgush, for illiterate ramblings for cheap understanding the simple the inverse, the compost, the reverse, the obtuse and stupid, and business, and business, and cheap, stupid lyrics, and simple mass reverse while the real thing is dying

Off with his head, take his head from his neck off, requiring memories both lovely and guiltfree, put out his eyes, then cut his nose off, sanctimonious sycophants stir in the bushes, scoop out his brain, put a string where his ears were, all the king's horses and all the king's men, swing the whole mess at the end of the wire, scratch out his eyes with the tip of a razor, let the wire extend from the tip of a rose, Caroline, Caroline, Caroline, Oh! but retains the remnants of what once was a nose, pass me my robe, fill my bath up with water

jumpsuit and pig meat and making his fortune, while making them happy with the inverse and obverse and making them happy and making them happy with the coy and the stupid, just another dumb lackey, who puts out one thing, while singing the other, but the real thing's alone and it is no man's brother

No one knows no nose is good news and senseless extend the wine drink here toast to selfless ten year old port is perfect in court

oh, not to be whistled or studied or hummed or remembered at nights, when the I is alone, but to skewer and ravage and savage and split with the grace of a diamond, bellicose wit, to stun and to stagger with words as such stone, that those who do hear cannot again return home

Hello to Ray, hello to Godiva and Angel, who let you in? isn't it nice the party? aren't the lights pretty at night?

Contempt, contempt, and contempt for the seething for writhing and reeling and two-bit reportage, for sick with the body and sinister holy, the drown burst blue babies now dead on the seashore, the valorous horseman, who hang from the ceiling, the pig on the carpet, the dusty pale jissom, that has no effect for the sick with the see-saw, the inverse, obverse converse, reverse of reverse the diverse and converse of reverse and perverse and sweet pyrotechnics, and let's have another of inverse, converse, diverse, perverse and reverse, hell's graveyard is damned as they chew on their brains, the slick and the scum, reverse, inverse and perverse

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Interesting things: I just finished reading <em>The Most Human Human</em> by Brian Christian, a Brown alum who is actually coming to campus tomorrow to talk about his work, along with two other alumni who are also creative non-fiction authors. I'm excited. He's also basically the same person as me: Comp Sci. / Philosophy dual-concentrator, with interests in the humanities as well. Both of us are interested in writing, particularly creative nonfiction. One awesome thing in the book: A couple of times he quotes from "Brown University Professor Bernard Reginster" who I am actually taking a class with right now. He also mentions CS Professor Eugene Charniak, who I know by name, though I haven't taken anything with him yet. He also mentions a CS theory course he took senior year, which may be the course I am taking right now.

It's awesome, a really quick read, and quite thought-provoking. It's the kind of book you want to keep around for the bibliography alone. I've been on a roll, reading-wise recently, just yesterday finishing Alan Watt's <em>The Book - On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are</em>, which was pretty interesting, though I've not yet digested it. I'll render a verdict later, when I've had more time to consider it. (I just checked out his <a title="page on wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Watts">page on wikipedia</a>, which is pretty interesting. Also has a fantastic photograph of him; I don't know why I like it so much, but I love that photo.)

That's it for now, and goodnight.

  <title>Pillar to Post</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been actually trying to get people to visit my blog recently which is strange for two reasons: First, I am in the process of switching away from this blog at the moment, so it is probably a lot of effort that will have to be repeated when I have my new site. Second, now that I have a couple of followers, I feel obligated to only post when I have something meaningful and worthwhile to share, and since I pretty much never have something meaningful and worthwhile to share, I end up posting less frequently.

So, new plan. Return to my roots as utterly fearless blogger, posting whenever he pleases without concern for quality or anything else. I wonder if that is a noble ideal to strive towards. (That is an interesting philosophical question...)

This year I have become that which I used to loath, one of those people who walks around with over-ear headphones on, warm and safe in a personal bubble. I was previously under the impression that walking around with headphones on was rude, and I totally see why I would think that, but I've had a change of perspective. The new perspective: Fuck it, I enjoy listening to music, and I'm much happier to walk any distance if I can listen to music along the way. It's a great opportunity to do the kind of serious listening that I am unable to do when studying. Actually it is the college analogue of the listening I used to do when driving to and from school. So there.

I'm a lot more confident when listening to music as well. It turns out to be incredibly hard to feel self-conscious when listening to Sleater-Kinney or Fugazi. I have a low tolerance for being surrounded by people, and after a full day of class, I'll be desperate to get back to my suite to decompress for a while. But if I can listen to music, I can get brief periods of respite, even if just in the passing periods between classes. It's enough though, and I can stay out for a lot longer this way, and get a lot more done.

I think that's good for now,

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey, there really is nothing to see here, but I am just trying to make sure I post every day until I get back in the habit of doing so.

So that means I have to have no ambitions whatsoever for the content, and just let it be whatever happens to be on my mind today.

Today, I've thought about the following:

How I'm incredibly bad at time management. How I need to clearly decide when I am working and when I am not working. How I don't think of work I have to do in a way that allows me to do it, but rather I imagine a huge task in front of me, and get discouraged before starting.

Whatever.

I'm generally in a good mood, though I was annoyed by the rain today.

I would mention something musical, but I can't think of anything good right now.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So I've been really enjoying Lucinda Williams recently. <em>Car Wheels on a Gravel Road</em> is a brilliant album, and pretty much every song is fantastic. The title cut is incredible, and "Right in Time" and "Still I Long For Your Kiss" are two of the best love songs I've ever heard. I have <em>Sweet Old World</em> but I have yet to give it a listen. I want to make sure I've savored this album, really gotten all that I can out of it before I move on to her next one. What else have I been listening to? <em>Wild Gift</em> by X, <em>Country Life</em> by Roxy Music (the one with the infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Life_%28Roxy_Music_album%29">cover</a>), <em>Horses</em> by Patti Smith, <em>Pink Flag</em> by Wire, and a whole bunch of other junk.

Today, I had stellar time management, and had like my most productive day in years. I went to a cool talk by Ben Fry, creator of <a href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a>. It was awesome, and made me want to spend some more quality time with Processing, just playing around.

I have this realization every couple of weeks: I am 19 years old. I have a lot of life experience by now. I have a lot of knowledge. I have a lot to offer. I made a vow to do something important by the time I am 20 (as agreed upon by me and a friend, being reasonable), and I think I am on pace to have that done for sure. What important thing I will do is not yet known, but I am beginning to believe I have the ability to accomplish something great, and all I have to do is continue along the path I'm taking.

For my creative nonfiction class, I've been assigned to write a feature piece (travel writing and science writing both fit the bill, though pretty much anything can be made into a feature with the appropriate angle). Anyway, I've been really interested in the intersection of Computer Science and Philosophy for a couple months, and I've wanted to sort out my thoughts on the subject in writing, so I was incredibly excited when I got the assignment, thinking I could make CS/Philosophy my topic. Only now am I beginning to realize that the paper I want to write is nothing like a feature. While I don't have an academic paper in mind, I've been imagining something with far more rigorous reasoning and careful analysis than in a typical magazine piece (not to disparage the quality of these pieces, but they usually have stories they tell, as opposed to ideas that they elaborate on). So I don't know exactly what I'm going to do. Because I really like the topic, but the paper I'd be writing is for a different class, and would be pretty out-of-place in this class. I don't know if I can make a more personal paper out of the subject, and I don't want to force anything into the paper that doesn't belong there.

I've gotten a lot better recently at understanding all my social interactions in retrospect, which is really nice, but I still am unable to understand what's going on in the moment, and I inevitably end up confused. Whatever.

Other observation: I've gotten much better at the business of living. The business of going about my day no longer demands my full attention, and I can focus my energies on other things. I'm confident that I will eat something close to 3 meals every day, that I will go to sleep before 3am, that I can repeat this <em>ad infinitum</em> without anything spiraling out of control. And so now I can pay a lot more attention to what I actually do during a day. And by pay attention, I mean worry. But hey, at least I'm not worrying about the same old shit. I have new shiny things to worry about!!!!

I've gone way over my self-imposed minimum word count, and if I say too much, I'll have trouble tomorrow, so I'm done here.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey, it's me.

The title of this post is me just free-associating. I do this quite often, relishing in striking juxtapositions and weird rhythms. I feel like I've gotten quite good at it, that I can free-associate with the best of them.

I don't know if it is much a talent, at least in this form, but if I could corral it into something more structured, I think I could make something pretty cool.

Whatever. "Solsbury Hill".

I'm in a good mood, buoyant and queasy, unsettled, ready to fight. And now I have to do all the work that I've put off doing this weekend, but I don't mind all that much.

I've been reading this philosopher at Oxford, Luciano Floridi. He's best known for his work in the Philosophy of Computer Science and he is by far the most well-read philosopher I've ever seen. He seems to actually be familiar with the practical tools and technologies used by a programmer on a day-to-day basis, which is rare for a practicing philosopher. When I read his book, I am inspired to read so much more. He seems to be doing philosophy at a different level than most of the people I've been read, and his mastery of the standard analytic toolkit used in philosophical discussion is unparalleled. It's hard to communicate what it is like to read his stuff without specifics, so here's an example:

I'm reading <em>Philosophy of Information</em> and the introductory chapter attempts to give some context for the discussion to follow and to sketch out possible approaches to the topic at hand. Section 1.7 is called "The metaphysical approach to PI [Philosophy of Information]", and is about 7 pages long. In this short section Floridi starts with Plato, and tells a grand narrative of the history of philosophy, leading to the current day, and explains how the philosophy of information can provide a metaphysical basis for scientific realism and semantics without raising the sorts of ontological concerns that led to the breakdown of prior metaphysical schemas. I don't know if that is the least bit helpful in making it clear why Floridi is so awesome.

Anyway, I have a lot to read, and I'm super-psyched to read it all!!

I just spent like 20 minutes trying to figure out how to talk about Floridi, and I really should do the work that I have to do now, so that's it.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Update: I'm back home in Los Angeles. Flew out of Boston on Wednesday morning, got here around noon, and am here until Sunday morning.

Mostly been catching up on sleep. It turns out I had a lot to catch up on.

Relaxing, which has been nice. I've seen my parents and sisters, which has also been nice.

In the little time I have had, I've also spent some time tinkering with my website. I think it is almost ready to publish. Maybe two or three more days of polishing before I have a version I'm comfortable releasing to the public.

I'm excited about that. Reading some good books as well. Listening to some good music.

Album recommendation: <em>The New Year</em> by The New Year.

I've been thinking a lot about the way I interact with people, and I've been a lot more confident recently, felt a lot better about just saying whatever I want, regardless of how it may be perceived. (I don't go around saying horribly insulting things, so any worries about how things may be perceived are usually needless and detrimental to my ability to participate in a conversation.) I'm getting better at participating in conversations, as opposed to observing them. Even so, I see myself standing back when I would like to participate.

Ever since one of my many readers decided to read a post aloud to me, I've been feeling really self-conscious about what I write, wondering how it would sound aloud.

I just realized that I've been implicitly assuming that I was the only subject of this blog, and as such, I haven't ever really had any other characters in any of my posts. But this is an unnaturally limiting way to be, and I will henceforth have characters. For the sake of privacy, names will be changed.

Wow, I started to do a whole anecdote-type thing, but I've decided not to, and I'm gonna wrap up for the night.

From the Western edge of the world,

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm on a plane, Southwest flight 1004, Phoenix to Providence, and I've just been writing for the last hour-and-a-half. And I've been absurdly productive, and I'm already worrying about whether or not I'll be able to replicate this feat next time I sit down to write. Arguments for: I've left so much unfinished that I can instantly begin filing in. I've switched back to the quantity phase of writing, where I just try and break personal word-count records, try to have so much stuff down on the page that I can just curate myself to end up with a finished product.

What changed? I can't articulate it exactly at the moment. I guess I started to pull away from my piece, started to treat it as a piece of art, rather than a self-portrait. It is an autobiography, so the subject is still myself, but I was somehow able to step aside, and think about my life as material, to be put to use in crafting a compelling story. I have some strong material, though I think it could be a lot better, and I'm gonna try to live in such a way as to generate the best material for writing about. Right now, if I had to take a guess as to what I'd end up doing with my life, I'd probably go with writer, probably non-fiction, though I can't get more specific than that. The writer's life seems pretty pleasant, pretty comfortable.

Here's a question which, if it isn't utterly nonsensical and ill-posed, might be interesting. Is the stuff of literature, the themes, the images, the symbols out there, existing in the world, waiting for the artist to latch on to it? Or is it all a fiction, the wishful thinking of primates primed for pattern recognition? (I can think of a couple different ways of starting to answer that question, but I'm not sure I feel like any of them are satisfactory. Does that reflect poorly on me, in that I have an answer in mind, and I am desperate for some way to rationalize it?)

I'm noticing that I keep revisiting a few themes in everything I do. Like, I wrote a paper last year that attempted to answer the above question in the affirmative? (With tons of caveats and nuances that end up denying the premises of the question, but still answer affirmative in the spirit of the question.) At the moment, I can't put my finger on what exactly it is that compels me to questions of this sort (whatever questions of this sort are), and what I seem to be driving towards. I feel like this is one of those things where I have to wait to suddenly have insight into the issue, and where any attempt at analysis will inevitably frustrate me, and do nothing to answer any of my questions.

I got one hour of sleep last night for no good reason. Anyway, I'm really tired now. I'm going to try and go to sleep really soon. I want to make a list of words that I have to learn the definitions of.

Words I've found so far: Apposite

I've forgotten the rest.

G'night.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm a sucker for a well-done expression of pure, unadulterated rage. Found a new one today: by Graham Parker &amp; The Rumour, "Don't Ask Me Questions"
<blockquote>Crimson autograph is what we leave behind
Everywhere man set foot.
War mongers laughing loud behind a painted face
Throwing titbits to the crowd then blowing up the place.

Hey Lord don't ask me questions, Hey Lord don't ask me questions
Hey Lord don't ask me questions please!
Hey Lord don't ask me questions, Hey Lord don't ask me questions
Hey Lord ain't no answer in me. (Solo)

Well I stand up for liberty but can't liberate
Pent up agony I see you take first place.
Well who does this treachery I shout with bleeding hand
Is it you or is it me well I never will understand.

Hey Lord don't ask me questions, Hey Lord don't ask me questions
Hey Lord don't ask me questions please!
Hey Lord don't ask me questions, Hey Lord don't ask me questions
Hey Lord ain't no answer in me. (Solo)

Well I see the thousands screaming rushing for the cliffs
Just like lemmings into the sea, Well well well
Who waves his mighty hand and breaks the precious rules?
Well the same one must understand who wasted all these fools.

Hey Lord don't ask me questions, Hey Lord don't ask me questions
Hey Lord don't ask me questions please!
Hey Lord don't ask me questions, Hey Lord don't ask me questions
Hey Lord ain't no answer in me. (Solo)</blockquote>
Also, like everything ever by Titus Andronicus.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>American Squirm</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I couldn't get to sleep last night. Was in bed at 2am, tossed for ~1hour before giving up and getting out of bed. I decided to read until I was tired, and then try again. At 3:30am I gave it another shot, but no luck, and at 4:30 I got out of bed again. More reading. At 6am I find myself mind awake, and decide to admit defeat, and spend my newfound free time productively. So I walked a mile to my barber of choice, a grumpy Eastside fixture who still does straight-razor shaves, and opens his place at 6am sharp every weekday.

Here's a super abstract method I've realized I use when I produce my best writing: The basic idea is to keep switching up the distance from which you are considering the work. So, if I'm writing an essay, I write a paragraph, trying to make a specific point, without worrying about how it fits into the context of the rest of the piece. I then step back and consider it structurally. I then look at sentences. I keep changing perspectives, thinking about the piece of at all all different levels.

I've come to believe that one of the markers of great art is that it works on many different levels. A great novel has interesting sentences, interesting paragraphs, interesting chapters, etc... This theory accounts for my lukewarm reaction to cheap thrillers and stuff like <em>Of Mice and Men</em>. Both of them are concerned with the larger units of meaning, and at the sentence level, there's none of the complexity and artfulness that may be present in the plot as a whole. You have to kinda read them and ignore the lower-level writing in anticipation of the higher-level payoff. On the other hand, a truly great work is compelling on all scales, and as a result, you don't have to direct your attention to a specific aspect, but can instead let yourself just experience the work freely moving between sentences and chapters, paragraphs, and plots. That's the theory. I might elaborate later.

Also, didn't mention it at the time, but the last post was my 100th!. This is 101. So there.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm in the basement of the library, the only floor on which I could find an empty desk. I've been here for about two hours now, reading like 80 pages of Ronald Fairbairn, on Object Relations theory. Now, I'm procrastinating with this post, and I'll soon move on to the task of summarizing some Gottlob Frege for my Philosophy of Mathematics final on Tuesday. I'm listening to Graham Parker and the Rumour's <em>Howling Wind</em>, an album which I liked at first, but which keeps rising in my estimation, and is now in my top ten albums of the year. It is pretty much perfect, and I've thought at least three or four different tracks were my favorite already, which invariably happens with albums that I go on to fall in love with.

I'm getting into Australian rock, mostly through the Church's <em>Heyday</em>, which is a remarkable album. I should get to Frege now, so that's it.

I'll post sometime later this weekend probably.

  <title>The Aetiology of Tristesse</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, the semester is pulling to a close, with a whimper. I suppose that is how things go.

I'm tired of not getting mathematical logic, and I've given myself the insane and probably unrealistic goal of working through all the exercises in Warren Goldfarb's <em>Deductive Logic</em> over break. I'm tired of not being able to understand with all the technicality Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems.

New finds:

<em>How Will The Wolf Survive?</em> - Los Lobos

<em>Heyday</em> - The Church

That last post was a draft that I never published, so I just published it then, and it didn't count. That's my excuse for posting twice in a day.

I'm getting really interested in Dummett and Wittgenstein, Sellars, Pierce, Schopenhauer. But I always have more than enough to read.

Gonna try and finally read the entirety of the <em>Cryptonomicon</em> as well. Also wanna read <em>The Year of Magical Thinking</em>, <em>The Stranger</em>, and something by Dostoyevsky, probably <em>Notes from the Underground</em>. Other plans include starting my own programming language, getting my website fully operational, punching holes in walls, tipping vending machines over, crying alone in a canoe, spinning until I throw up, reading Kripke, naturalizing epistemology, metaphysics, and your mom.

It would be an exaggeration to say that I am having a nervous breakdown right now, but I think it would to be call it a nervy stutter, a swampy mutter.

I have been angry recently, a feeling which I'd forgotten for a while, and which is unfamiliar, uncomfortable, and a little bit more fun than I'd remembered. It feels good to swell with righteous anger, at least until your bubble bursts, at which point you just feel stupid, and wallow in self-pity.

My body is tired. My mind is tired. I'm gonna go to sleep. Australian singers sound great. The accent is transformed into this endlessly elegant, rich, boundlessly wise voice.

Also: <em>Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness</em> - Smashing Pumpkins

At 28 tracks it is huge, and bloated, but you'd be surprised at how much of it holds up really well.

D. W. Winnicott makes a lot of sense, and his junk has the ring of truth. Same with Heinz Kohut.

Plums and paper. Scrambling, babbling lease on life. Pillow fights. Younger the Elder. Cato, and Brueghel. The Dakotas.

Finished <em>The Deptford Trilogy</em> for the second time yesterday. Just as good as I'd remembered, or better. A wonderful world you hate to leave.

-Spencer

It's getting cold, someone said 20s today, but I didn't check. No snow, don't think there'll be any before I'm back in the City of Angles. (Not a typo) (Maybe a pun) Whatever.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I can't seem to figure out what's behind my absurd traffic on the blog.

Example: two days ago I had 10 hits, which might not seem like a lot, but given that my all-time high is 11 on a day, I was pretty jazzed. The next day, though, I had exactly 0 hits. Weird stuff.

I just got through finals, think they all went well. Anyway, now I'm faced with more free time than I know what to do with, and I'm not exaggerating in the slightest.

I need some absurdly over-ambitious goal to achieve, or else I'll be bored out of my mind.

---------- (1 day later) --------

I have some ideas. I'll let you know how they go.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I saw <em>A Seperation</em> tonight. It's as good as everyone says it is. I thought it was fantastic, a brilliantly constructed naturalistic look into the lives of two families in modern-day Iran. I don't really want to say much about it, but go see it as soon as possible. You won't be sorry. As a music fanatic (or whatever you call people like me), I love the year-end lists of the top albums/singles/artists/performances of the year and look forward to discovering all sorts of new music through them. I've decided to construct my own list of my favorite albums discovered over the past year. My recollection as to when I started getting into an album is not that great, so odds are I'll make some mistakes, listing albums I discovered in 2010, and not 2011. I listened to a ridiculous amount of new music in 2011, and I'm sure my musical knowledge expanded more in this past year than in three or four prior years. There's way more than I can fit on a reasonable list, so there are tons of albums that are getting slighted, and I'll take a look at those later, but anyway, here goes: (note: the order is meaningless, and mostly reflects the fact that I went through my library in alphabetical order) After each album, I have some notes, but at the bottom of the post I include the full list of names for quick browsing.

<strong>Update</strong>: Ok, so I realized that writing 23 commentaries is going to take quite a long time, and while I still want to do it, I think I will instead publish each commentary separately as its own post, which will allow me to get this published right now, and add notes as needed.

Upon going through my entire iTunes library, I have found 22 albums from 2011 that deserve a spot on the list, and I don't want to slight any of them with only an honorable mention, so they have all been included. Every single one of these albums is well worth your hard-earned cash, and will reward you with endless replayability. I wouldn't say that they are all perfect albums, but they are all incredibly enjoyable, and the kind of album that I know will make me feel good as soon as it begins.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey,

So I just accidentally published a post before it was finished, and that means that all of my subscribers got emails from me containing that post.

I've since removed it from the site, but you can still read it in email form. (Fun game: Can you tell where the post is incomplete????) I guess I am just going to republish it tomorrow, once I've fixed it up.

But anyway, I feel stupid.

  <title>Spencer's Albums of 2011: "Album" by Girls</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[First off, it's really difficult to talk about this choice, as neither the band name or the album name is a proper noun or a phrase. Anyway, I listened to <em>Album</em> a couple of times without really getting what all the fuss was about, though I immediately saw the appeal of "Lust for Life" and "Laura". After enough listens though, I realized just how fantastic it is, and I've been playing it non-stop ever since. The album consists of song after song of shambling psychedelic pop, strangely familiar tunes sung in a fragile voice that sounds just on the edge of tears. Cristopher Owens sings about loneliness and despair with refreshing honesty, as exemplified by the chorus from the opener, "Lust for Life": "But now I'm just crazy, I'm totally mad / Yeah, I'm just crazy, I'm fucked in the head / And maybe if I tried with all of my heart / Then I could make a brand new start in love with you". This album is utterly devoid of subtlety, and filled with gigantic sentiment, but it works perfectly, and you never doubt the truth of any of it for a second. I've been thinking about this album for a while now, and I've had trouble figuring out what it is I like about the album so much. It puzzles me, but I keep listening, and you should too.

<strong>QUICK INTERRUPTION FOR BREAKING NEWS</strong>

I learned a new word: Perspicuous. It is an adjective, and is used in two ways. 1) When used to describe an explanation or story or account, it means "clearly expressed and easily understood; lucid". 2) When used to describe a person, it means "able to to give an account or express an idea clearly." It can also be used as an adverb, in which case it means "transparent, or clear". (By the way definitions are shamelessly stolen from Apple's Dictionary software, which itself uses definitions from elsewhere. I don't know where it ends.)

I came across the word in Warren Goldfarb's <em>Deductive Logic</em> in his account of the process used to translate any truth-functional schema to a standardized form (DNF). Comparing the schema before and after reduction he says "Schema (2) is far more perspicuous than schema (1)". While I realize that it is hard to evaluate the particular usage of the word without seeing both schemas, you'll have to take my word for it that he's right.]]></content:encoded>

I just fixed the one remaining crazy bug in my site that was keeping me from publishing it. Now I can go ahead and publish it. I will do that tomorrow. It's been so long that I couldn't even imagine what it was like to have it actually working. I'll post again when it is finally up.

  <title>A Message to You Rudy</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Its' been a while since I last posted. Life's been good, busy but good. School's started. Gotta narrow 7 courses down to 5 (or maybe just 4). I hate this part.

Just started up "Marquee Moon" on the album of the same title. 10min:47secs of guitar wizardry, shrill shrieks, lightning strikes.

Good stuff.

Finished <em>Notes From the Underground</em>, though I think I might have mentioned that in a previous post. Anyway, it's fantastic, and unlike anything else I've ever read. Don't know what to make of it. But then again, that seems to be my catchphrase in these salad days. Days of milk and honey? Days of split ends, and skywriting, clouds spazzing through the skies. Someone should give Tom Verlaine a medal .

Aztec grips, burning bridges, and fiddling through the flames. Oppenheimer looks out from under that comically oversized hat, skeletal and ominous. Fifth street is an ace, and we're back in business, humming and skimming. Dizzying heights, blinded by the light, Mike Skinner said a long time ago.

I should get to work, so bye.

  <title>I'm a street walkin' cheetah with a heart full of napalm; Spencer's Albums of 2011: "Majesty Shredding" by Superchunk</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I feel kind of stupid.

I just gave up on something I shouldn't have given up on. I let myself be paralyzed by the fantasy that I was walking into a place where my very presence offended, where the brute fact of my breath caused the world to wobble.

Put in other words, I chickened out. It's a really unpleasant sensation, to feel as though you offend with your very existence, to feel as though the best thing you could do would be to curl up and collapse inward, implode and pop out of existence. Don't try it at home.
<h4><em>Majesty Shredding</em> by Superchunk:</h4>
I have a weakness for power-pop, hooky chorus-driven songs that soar and dive, and at their best feel like a roller-coaster ride. This is one of the best power-pop albums I've ever heard. It's short and sweet, at 42 minutes and 11 songs. Song after song twists and turns and dazzles, and you want to sing along from the opening chord. Mac McCaughan sings his heart out and the guitars sear, and the drums don't once let up. The world created by this album is an electric winter wonderland, a cozy cabin surrounded by dense woods where sparks and snowflakes whirl in the chill air. It's a thrilling album, and since I've found it, it's been on constant rotation, a guaranteed pick-me-up, a lightning bolt to the heart. One of my favorite moments is the chorus of "Slow Drip":
<blockquote>"... and every time I thought it couldn't get worse, I'd start to wake up and I'd see the nurse.

She said "You checked in with a broken heart. We don't even know where to start.

I just put something in your line, it's starting to drip, it's gonna take its time.

The next voice you hear, well it won't be mine. I think you'd better wake up. I think you'd better wake up one more time"</blockquote>
<em>Majesty Shredding</em> is the ultimate wake-up call, an unmatched collection of wonderful tunes, and a testament to the power of pop done right.

  <title>It's been a while</title>
  <link>http://starlingsoftheslipstream.wordpress.com/2012/02/24/its-been-a-while/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey,

It's been a while since my last post, and I'm a little annoyed at how infrequently I've been posting recently. I would like to be writing more, and this blog is about the only context in which I write write these days (excluding programming) and so I'd like to keep it up to date if only to exercise my writing muscle, which has been withering away.

That being said, the topic for right now is programming language design:

Basically, I love functional programming, and my favorite all-around language is Haskell. I recently have been working on a project that will take graphs and animate various algorithms on them. I initially wrote this in Haskell, but then I decided that I'd like to have something that is more easily accessible, that can be accessed by anyone, and so I rewrote it in Javascript, which was quite an educational experience.

Comparing the experience of writing the same program functionally and imperatively, I can see very clearly places where one functional programming gets really really awkward, and I can see places where the imperative version becomes very error-prone, in contrast to the almost inevitable correctness of the functional version. That's all very diplomatic, and of no help to the vehement language partisans that haunt the internet, looking for incendiary blog posts upon which to unleash their vitriol and fervor.

Javascript vs. Haskell with respect to Stateful Data Structures:

Basically, you can't directly mutate anything in Haskell. You can get around this by using a State Monad, but it's hard and annoying, and I would much rather just be able to manipulate state directly.

So here is my idea for a programming language: By default, everything is imperative, with mutable state and all that jazz. But you can designate certain regions as purely functional, and define all sorts of functions in those regions that could then be used in the rest of the program.

The functional parts of the program would have to be secondary to the imperative ones for the simple reason that the very act of running a program requires IO and state, and is intrinsically side-effect having.

The functional parts of the program would allow you to demarcate functions that are guaranteed to be free of side effects, and which you can reason about assuming referential transparency.

Ideally then, you would do all IO and storage and retrieval of state in the imperative sections, and use the functional sections for the heavy-duty data transformations in which 95% of bugs would eventually be located.

I like the idea, but I haven't fully thought it through at all, and so there may be some obvious flaws.

Anyway, if you have any comments, feel free to comment, as that is what the comments sections here is for.

Goodnight, and sleep tight, cruel world,

-Spencer

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello,

I've not been blogging. It irritates me. I need to blog.

I've come to the conclusion that the exercise of blogging is good for me, and is vital to my continued growth as a human being. Stefan Sagmeister writes "Keeping a diary supports personal development", and I agree with him entirely.

I've been listening to a ton of different music recently, too much new stuff to list. I've been thinking about theoretical computer science a lot, and math. Math is really messed up. I feel like anyone who puts more than a moment of thought into trying to figure out just what Math is will realize that no one has any idea, and that we are nowhere near a satisfactory answer. They also will see the various intuitions that lead to the major schools of thought re: the nature of mathematics. Add in computer science, and you have quite a clusterfuck. I hesitated before using that particular word in that last sentence, and then decided for it, on the grounds of "fuck it", the universal grounding for all decisions unsupported by reason. How sweet it is to be young and impulsive, flush with passion and such and stuff.

Blah, blah, blah, music, philosophy, computer science, books, I'm going to go take a shower, and then a nap. College is super exciting!!!

From an unseasonably and suspiciously warm Providence,

-Spencer

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So for fun, I've been working on some animations for algorithms recently.

I've succeeded in getting a couple working and online, and though they're definitely a work-in-progress, I'm happy to present what I have so far:

They are available at: <a title="algorithms" href="http://algorithm.herokuapp.com">algorithm.herokuapp.com</a>. At that page, you will see animations of <a title="Prim's Algorithm" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm">Prim's</a> and<a title="Kruskal's Algorithm" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm"> Kruskal's</a> algorithms for finding minimum spanning trees.

If you instead go to <a title="Huffman coding" href="http://algorithm.herokuapp.com/huffman.html">algorithm.herokuapp.com/huffman.html</a> you can see the animation I've made for <a title="Huffman coding" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding">Huffman coding</a>. I don't have any explanations of the algorithms at the moment, so it is quite possible that they will make no sense whatsoever, but if you go to wikipedia, it should e possible to get a sense of what is going on. Anyway, check them out, and let me know what you think.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Not much to say, gonna grab a snack. Been getting deeper into computer science. I'm getting obsessed, but then again that's the name of the game. The best are the most obsessed. Finals approaching like a brick wave.

I'm back, everyone.

I was kind of just typing this here, and leaning back in my chair, and debating whether to get involved with the whole enterprise, and the answer is yes. I am recalling a promise I made to myself back when I started this blog: lack of content was never going to stop me from publishing; lack of quality was never going to stop me from publishing. So here goes nothing, literally.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I have been undergoing a process of intense self-analysis, and have discovered the shocking fact that I tend to post here around once a month, foaming at the mouth with enthusiasm, and claiming to be back for good, whilst gesticulating wildly. But then I don't post for a while. Who would've thought it?

Content: This summer is crazy!! Going to be going to France, Italy, Spain, Egypt, Senegal!! That's a lot of countries. Super-exciting! Also going to be working on all sorts of personal projects in the meantime. Super-exciting! I'll keep you (my faithful audience) posted!

Exclamation point! Exclamation point? Filler!

  <title>Syntactic Sugar</title>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So, anyone who's tried learning a couple of different programming languages has undoubtedly been exposed to the phrase "syntactic sugar", and has probably got a rough idea of what it means. Basically, syntactic sugar describes syntactic constructs that are designed solely for convenience, as they do not allow a programmer to express something that would otherwise be impossible to express, but rather they make it easier to write something down. An example:

In ruby, one can write the following:
<pre>%w[hello my name is spencer]</pre>
to create an array of strings that is identical to what you would get if you wrote the following instead:
<pre>["hello","my","name","is","spencer"]</pre>
The former is just a convenient alternative syntax to make it less cumbersome to write down the latter. That's the essence of syntactic sugar. However, to me that seems insufficiently rigorous, and so I propose a more rigorous definition: For a syntactic construct to be considered syntactic sugar, one has to be able to specify the semantics of the construct by translation into the language in question. In the example above, you can specify the semantics of the former expression in terms of the latter, and show the way in which the former is mechanically translated to the second.

While I think this definition is about right, it raises some interesting questions that need to be answered before I would assert its correctness. How does one determine which of two constructs is syntactic sugar and which is the "real" syntax? Intuitively, it would seem like the syntax that is more general is the real syntax, so that if you have syntax <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>, it might be the case that you can always translate <strong>A</strong> <strong>-&gt;</strong> <strong>B</strong> and preserve the semantics of the program, but that you can not always translate <strong>B -&gt; A</strong>, and get a valid program, or that if you do get a valid program, it may not have the same behavior as the original.

What got me thinking about this is the claim often made that <strong>do-notation</strong> in Haskell is syntactic sugar (I agree that it is), and the fact that <strong>let and where</strong><strong> </strong>seem to both be possible candidates for that designation as well, yet I don't recall having seen them described in that way. I think the reason that they are not described as such is that they can have drastic effects on program performance as a result of sharing enabled by both constructs. In theory, the following lines are interchangeable:
<pre>let a = exp in f a + g a
f exp + g exp</pre>
However, the first one explicitly signals to the compiler that the arguments to <strong>f</strong> and <strong>g</strong> are the same, and that the expression can be evaluated once, and then its result used twice, while the second one makes this sharing implicit, and requires a compiler to optimize the program to avoid recomputing the expression. Thus, the two differ with respect to program performance, despite being indistinguishable with respect to functional behavior. Because the two are not then identical, it would be incorrect to say that <strong>let </strong>is syntactic sugar, at least if the compiler generates different code for the two examples. I am not sure if the programs actually are functionally equivalent, since it may be the case that they diverge when given bottom as an input, depending on the specification of the functions in question. I could be wrong though, and I welcome any corrections anyone may have.

I have more to say on the topic, but I'll save it for future posts.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey, so I just got back from my 8-week epic journey across the globe (Actually, I didn't go to Asia, Antarctica, South America, or Australia, so I don't know if it really qualifies as travelling the world). I now have three-ish free weeks in Los Angeles for reflection, renewal, and lazing around. I figure this is as good a time as any to blog until my fingers bleed into the keys on my laptop keyboard. (I like that image.)

I'll talk more later about the different places I traveled, but a quick summary:

2 weeks in France, outside Aix-en-Provence, then a night in Marseilles, then a night in Lyon, then a train to Chambery, and then Milan, and then Florence. A couple of nights in Florence. Then a plane over to Barcelona for a couple of nights. Then we fly to Sharm-el-Sheikh via Cairo, and enjoy the Red Sea for a few days. I then go to Cairo, and explore for a week. Then to Dakar, via Tunis, where I spend 3 weeks living in Yoff, and discovering Senegal. Yesterday morning, I arrived back in LA.

More later.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So I recently made a sudoku solver. It took about 2.5 months, and I rewrote it about three times. I started in Javascript, then moved to Haskell, where I stayed ever since. It works now, as far as I can tell, and it should be easy to get it generating boards. That would be cool.

Uggh, this jetlag is really wearing on me. I am having immense trouble staying up to 10:30 pm, let alone midnight. I am getting absurdly tired just being myself, which is not conducive to working hard.

I'm going to go to sleep right now.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey,

I've been listening to Fleetwood Mac's <em>Tusk</em>, which is a strange and wonderful album. I have no idea what to make of it, but I know that I like it a lot. Fleetwood Mac continues to rise in my estimation. I'm back in Providence, just moved in. Trying to fix my room up to be a space in which I can live and work and play. It's been taking forever, but it's shaping up nicely, and by tonight I think I'll be happy with it.

My favorite songs on <em>Tusk</em> thus far are all composed by Buckingham. On "What Makes You Think You're the One" and "Not That Funny" (both of which have him on the lead vocals, I believe), he doesn't really sing so much as yelp, over a bombastic rhythm section that's almost a march. He whines and pleads, and the guitars chime behind him, and the drums pound, and I love it.

He has a really interesting voice, a little high and sweet, a little breathy and dry. It's pretty distinctive, and once you hear it, and pin a name to it, you don't forget it. On <em>Rumours</em>, he sings lead on "Second Hand News", "Never Going Back Again", and "Go Your Own Way".

I thinking I'm getting boring as I mature. Opinions?

So a while back I had a really really good idea for a paper I could publish, perhaps in the <em>Journal of Functional Programming</em>, perhaps as a Functional Pearl. Then I did my research, and found out someone had written it already, and published it in that same venue, as a Functional Pearls. I then raised my fists to the sky, and cursed the heavens. The really annoying part is knowing that my idea was spot on, and good enough to merit publication in a pretty prestigious journal. So I was  on the right path, only 16 years after it had been first taken. It's like landing on the moon, stepping out onto the surface, only to find a flag there, reminding you that someone beat you to the punch. (I exaggerate of course.)  Okay, I should get moving now, sieze the day and such.

-Spencer

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Listen to "Still Life" by <em>Suede</em> on <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Dog Man Star</span>. Then listen to the rest of the album. It is utterly fantastic, and you will not be sorry for having done so. That's about all I have to say right now. Also, I can't believe that it is 2012, and that I'm more than half-way done with college. Man, stuff happens quickly.  Goodnight, moon.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi,

Super quick for you busy readers. Really busy, doing work for programming languages and stuff. But not bad at all. Just wanted to keep posting, so I can get in the habit. Life's good. Album of the day: <em>Another Green World, </em>just because I haven't really listened to anything today that I haven't mentioned recently, and it's a pretty awesome album. Whatever.

Goodnight, stars.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[The title of this post is a slogan we found painted on the side of a house somewhere on Ives St. the summer after Freshman year.

Today I went to Iron Wok with Rie. Our fortunes:

Mine first: <strong>Every production of genius must be the production of enthusiasm.</strong>

Hers: <strong>Here we go. Low fat, whole wheat green tea.</strong>

Ponder them, and perhaps you will discover things you never even thought were true. Or something like that. Dropped Spinoza today, down to four courses. I like them all, though we'll see what I say when going gets tough.

Decided to re-read <em>The Diamond Age</em>, and getting really excited about that. Looking into automated theorem proving. Done proving theorems by hand. (jk). I actually want to convert some of the formal apparatus of Gödel's Incompleteness theorems into computer programs. I want to see what <a title="Robinson Arithmetic" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinson_arithmetic">Robinson Arithmetic</a> can prove, and what <a title="Peano Arithmetic" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_arithmetic">Peano Arithmetic</a> can prove above and beyond that. Plus, it'll give me a chance to exercise my itch to program cool shit.

Nothing else new. So it goes. (There is a song of that name by Nick Lowe on <em>Jesus of Cool</em>. Check it out.

G'night.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[So ever since I saw the trailer for the <em>Les Miserables</em> movie, I've wanted to find out more about the musical, the novel. After a fair amount of research, I've decided to read the novel, the whole thing (1400 pages)! We'll see if I can do it. From what I've heard, I'm in for quite a ride.

In other news, work is working out okay, done desugaring Parseltongue (Visit the <a title="Programming Languages site" href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2012/">course website</a> to learn what I'm talking about.) Don't really have all that much else to say. Life is good these days. Been listening to ABC. Check out <a title="The Look of Love" href="http://youtu.be/pIeggnBzITA">"The Look of Love"</a> or <a title="Poison Arrow" href="http://youtu.be/SX09N-0FZW4">"Poison Arrow"</a>. You won't be sorry! Also, gonna start reading the <em>Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant</em> soon, getting very psyched.

And back to work!

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been on a really serious mathematical logic kick recently, mostly due to a course I'm taking right now (Topics in Logic: Incompleteness). I have no formal background in mathematical logic so I have spent the first couple weeks madly trying to teach myself two semesters of mathematical logic. I 'm beginning to see the light as I get the hang of it, but now I'm addicted and I can't get enough.

I also really want to program myself a proof-assistant for first-order logic, because that sounds incredibly cool, and invaluable in learning it beyond all doubt. Also, I basically think logic programming is the way of the future, and should be learning Prolog anyway.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey,

I'm back.

This post is about me not going to sleep even though I'm not doing anything at all, and despite my being entirely aware that I will be unhappy tomorrow if I don't go to sleep soon. So why am I awake?

I think it is because when I go to sleep I will have conceded to myself that I am done for the day, that I will get no more done today than is already done, and that this day will slip out of my grasp, and the mountain of work ahead of me will loom larger.

That being said, having publicly admitted this unproductive and self-defeating mindset, I feel much better about now getting up, leaving my room, and brushing my teeth in preparation for the warm and soft embrace of my bed and a good night of sleep.

Writing that was incredibly rewarding. I should do this more often. Goodnight, everyone.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I want to make a piece of software that can visualize graphs really easily. So I input a graph as a list of vertices and edges, and the software does its stuff and I can see that graph right in front of me.

And now I want to play around with that graph. So I want to add edges, one at a time. I type in a pair of coordinates, and that edge pops in to existence. I want to compute the neighbors of a vertex. Done!

I want to simulate a random walk. I say "add walker at vertex 12". The node is colored to reflect that. I now say "walk 5 steps", and the guy moves step by step, randomly to a new vertex.

For a class I'm taking this semester on Probablility and Computing, and for Algorithms classes I've taken in past semesters, I've thought it would be incredibly helpful to see these kinds behaviors on graphs, because previously I've had to draw things out by hand step by step, which gets incredibly tedious when I have more than like 10 nodes to draw.

This sounds like a really fun project. Another cool project. A text editor with macros enabled so that you can type "\not" and have that replaced with "¬" or I could say "\exists" and have that replaced with "∃". And then when I started to backspace onto that character, it would be replaced with the original text so that instead of deleting the entire symbol the first backspace would leave me with "\exist". This way I could dynamically adjust the symbolic shortcuts as desired. I also would want the program to save files in full expanded form, and only display them with symbols, so that they could be easily carried over to other platforms without any weird encoding issues.

There are things out there that accomplish parts of this, but nothing has yet been sufficient to satisfy my imagination.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I can't solve this one problem on my final for Probability and Computing. I've been working on it a lot. It's been driving me insane. I've written scripts to simulate stuff, to see if that would help. It didn't. I've read the relevant chapters of the book over and over again. Didn't get anywhere. I've thought really hard, with all of my brain, on the topic. I've slept on it. I've done it all to no avail.

Woe is me.

Also, Python is growing on me as a language.

It's not perfect by any means, but as far as interactive, exploratory stuff is concerned it beats everything else I've seen, by virtue of <strong>ipython</strong><em> </em>and <strong>matplotlib</strong>.

Why, oh why doesn't the qtconsole work right on MacOSX?

Will I ever know the answer to that question? Probably.

Will I ever know the solution to this problem. Probably.

Back to work.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Yay, I did it!!! Whee!!!! Now I just have to write it up!!!!!!! That will take a while, because I will have to clean up my reasoning, and formalize the ideas behind my proof, but I am still so excited!!! That's it.

I'd like to thank my family first. Without them, I wouldn't be here today, accepting this award for best mathematician in the whole wide universe. They've supported my mathy inclinations from a very young age. Thanks Mom. Thanks Dad. Thanks Sister who hosts awesome radio show that alienated entire fan base by playing showtunes once (I approve!!!!).  Thanks Sister who knows more about symbolic logic than I do (Gasp!!!!).  I love you guys!! :) Thanks awesome GF sitting across table from me. You're the best!

I'm going to go to dinner now, because I am hungry.

  <title>PAGEFAULT, HA HA HA HA HA 0xbbbbbbbb. </title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been trying to figure out why this test I've been running for the past two hours keeps failing right at the end. I stepped through it like an hour and a half ago, and that was unhelpful. It also made me think that the problem I was having was with an improperly deallocated VM area, or that somehow the combination of removing the VM area from my VM map's list of VM areas while simultaneously relinquishing it to the slab deallocator was causing the stupid list iteration macro to pagefault. (VM stands for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory">virtual memory</a>, which we are implementing in a fashion similar to the implementation on Linux or other Unixes) I'm not so sure that's the case anymore. Maybe it's somewhere else. I can't even figure out which is the problematic line.

When stepping through the code by hand I thought my linked list looked suspicious, and was totally convinced that there was something going on there, and I proceeded to draw out the entire linked list by hand (with hex memory addresses and everything). Turns out it was fine. I did find the reason that it looked suspicious though. Before I explain, let's see if you can figure it out! Below are snippets from my gdb sessions, the first is what I thought I was seeing, the second is what I actually was seeing. Have fun!

What I thought I read:
<pre>
(gdb) p map-&gt;vmm_list-&gt;l_next-&gt;l_next-&gt;l_next
$21 = (struct list *) 0xc1e6e548
(gdb) p *map-&gt;vmm_list-&gt;l_next-&gt;l_next-&gt;l_next
{ l_next: 0xc1e6e548, l_prev: 0xc1e6e50c }
</pre>

What I actually read: 
<pre>
(gdb) p map-&gt;vmm_list-&gt;l_next-&gt;l_next-&gt;l_next
$21 = (struct list *) 0xc1e6e548
(gdb) p *map-&gt;vmm_list-&gt;l_next-&gt;l_next-&gt;l_next
{ l_next: 0xc1e6e584, l_prev: 0xc1e6e50c }
</pre>

I'll ramble on for a little bit before revealing the answer, so that you don't cheat. So my Operating System is otherwise almost done. How would I describe it? Quirky, flawed. A lot of heart. Not production-ready. 

In other news, my sister is in town for a couple of days. It's really really nice, and I'm having a lot of fun, even though finals are making it very hard for me to spend much time with her. Also, I have stupidly let my sleep schedule slip later and later, and so I'm wide awake at 2:53am. I'm gonna try to go to sleep in like 10 minutes though, and hopefully I can keep it up, and be back on track by Thursday. 

Ok, here are the answers:

Turns out that
<pre>0xc1e6e584</pre>
and
<pre>0xc1e6e548</pre>
are almost indistinguishable after an hour of squinting at your screen. 

Isn't that fascinating? I still haven't figured out the problem. I'll let you know when (or if) I do figure it out. 

Goodnight everyone.
