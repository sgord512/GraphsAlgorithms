I've been thinking a lot recently about who my heroes are. For someone to be a hero to me, they must be fundamentally good, fundamentally concerned with the well-being of human kind, fundamentally kind to others. I can only think of a few people who fit that criterion, and I am on the fence about some of them. Maybe the only person who I truly believe is as good a person as can be is Mr. Rogers. Watch this clip: [youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXEuEUQIP3Q]. I love everything about this clip.
