<p> Hey, this is the homepage of Spencer Gordon. I am a sophmore at
Brown University, concentrating in Computer Science and Philosophy. I
am from Los Angeles, CA. I'm interested in music and the arts, and in
my spare time I like to write, particularly creative-nonfiction.

This site, which I plan to eventually turn into a personal site, right
now is home to a couple different visualizations of different
algorithms. I find it really helpful when thinking about algorithms to
be able to see exactly what's happening, and I created this site to
help me do that. The source for the site is available at <a
href="https://github.com/sgord512/GraphsAlgorithms">github</a>.

To get in touch with me, email me at <em> spencer gordon at brown dot
edu</em>, or at <em> sgord512 at gmail dot com </em> </p>
