TODO
====
1. I think I want to get Union-Find finished, b/c that was like the very first thing I wanted to implement, and I still haven't done it.
2. I think I want to get some handy data_structures, in place, particularly for representing dynamic sets. I don't at the moment have a consistent way of doing that, and it is making my life very difficult.
3. I want to get a better graph data_structure together, that I can use for a variety of different purposes.
4. Add interactivity to the cellular automata, so that users can play around with different rules, and modify the board.
5. Start a migration to Coffeescript, and get some build system up and running for that, b/c I am not totally pleased with what I have at the moment.
6. FIgure out some better way to load modules into the REPL for easy testing. I am getting tired of typing ".load loader.js" into the REPL, and modifying that file.
7. Add some documentation, clean up the code base a little. Settle upon some coding conventions.

8. Think about different ways of handling a Graph API.

9. Think about how to handle simulations with many different possible configurations. 
+ Want to be able to handle many different configurations
+ Don't want to idly eat up processor time
+ Need to acommadate a potentially unbounded number of elements.


This is OUT-OF-DATE. 

I would like to update this as soon as possible.
